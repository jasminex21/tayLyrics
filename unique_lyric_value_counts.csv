lyric,count
Today was a fairytale,16
"(Red, red, red)",14
Look what you just made me do,13
Ooh-ah,12
Take me away,12
What died didn't stay dead,12
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again,12
Then you were gonna come find me,11
I remember it all too well,10
Only bought this dress so you could take it off,10
All you had to do was (Stay),10
Look what you made me do,10
And that's how it works,10
"Don't look at me, you got a girl at home",9
Bye bye baby,9
"Oh, oh, oh",9
"(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)",9
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da,9
"Ooh, look what you made me do",9
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York",9
"(It's coming down, it's coming down)",8
"Wreck my plans, that's my man",8
I'm begging for you to take my hand,8
Let the games begin,8
Ooh,8
I think he knows,8
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?,8
Is it cool that I said all that?,8
Like snow on the beach,8
"My, my, my, my",8
Who's gonna hold you?,8
Said you were gonna grow up,8
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?,7
It must have been the way,7
Foolish one,7
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life,7
I wish you would,7
"Like we're made of starlight, starlight",7
Florida,7
"Soon, you'll get better",7
"Know you better, know you better now",7
I just wanna know you better,7
"Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you",7
"Oh, oh",7
You're still an innocent,7
In Wonderland,7
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh),7
Fuck it if I can't have him,7
And all you're ever gonna be is mean,7
Got a long list of ex-lovers,6
I forgot that you existed,6
Champagne problems,6
"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",6
"Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you",6
"But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man",6
"Don't blame me, love made me crazy",6
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?,6
"Uh huh, that's right",6
I thought I had you figured out,6
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground,6
"Ooh, we'll run",6
Even if it's a false god,6
"(Once, I had an empire)",6
It's like no matter what I do,6
"Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up",6
I think I've seen this film before,6
I regret you all the time,6
A message in a bottle is all I can do,6
"Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you",6
High infidelity,6
"So call it what you want, yeah",6
"I was dancing around, dancing around it",6
It's a cruel summer,6
Call it what you want to,6
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile,6
"Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good",6
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?,6
Let you know that what I feel is true,6
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake",6
"Oh, oh-oh",6
"The other half, I'm only tryna",6
"Yeah, yeah",6
"Well, you drive me crazy half the time",6
"Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good",6
So it goes...,6
Wish you knew that,6
"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that",6
But I'm gonna get you back,6
"I want you, bless my",6
Think about the place where you first met me,6
"You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together",6
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name,6
"Stop, you're losin' me",6
"So, so, so it goes",6
"Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied",6
"Yeah, we were dancing",6
And that's the way I loved you,6
"Come back, be here, come back, be here",6
"Yes, I got your letter",6
Evermore,6
"Yes, I'm doing better",6
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off",5
How did it end?,5
With you,5
But we were dancing,5
If you were a better man,5
Oh-oh,5
"Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?",5
Said it's still reserved for me,5
I'd be the man,5
And the road not taken looks real good now,5
"Mmm-mm, mm-mm",5
You said you were gonna grow up,5
"King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa",5
"Oh, I'm fallin' in love",5
"'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood",5
"I wanna be your end game, end game",5
You're gorgeous,5
You made a really deep cut,5
"I want you, bless my soul",5
"So (So) long (Long), London (London)",5
We're going to fly away from here,5
This slope is treacherous,5
"No, no, oh-oh",5
You're not sorry,5
I thought the plane was goin' down,5
"No, no body, no crime",5
That will find you the right thing,5
"I shake it off, I shake it off",5
I think I am finally clean,5
Now we got problems,5
"(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)",5
Getting back together,5
"We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it",5
'Cause the sign on your heart,5
"I love you, it's ruining my life",5
"Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah",5
That ain't never gonna come,5
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love,5
You still would've been mine,5
"It's me, hi",5
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying,5
"If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right",5
"Trouble, trouble, trouble",5
So shame on me now,5
"I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I",5
We'd still worship this love,5
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight",5
Look what you just made me-,5
"Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love",5
I knew you were trouble when you walked in,5
How'd you turn it right around?,5
"Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again",5
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?,5
When the sun goes down,5
"I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time",4
"Spinning in my highest heels, love",4
"Had me in the palm of your hand, then",4
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?,4
You're a cowboy like me,4
"Stay, stay, stay",4
But I don't wanna dance,4
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone,4
Everybody wants you,4
"You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad",4
"And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you",4
Shining just for you,4
And we're not speakin',4
"In a storm in my best dress, fearless",4
If I'm not dancing with you,4
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance,4
"'Cause I was there when you said, ""forever and always""",4
"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless",4
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart,4
Like it's killin' me? Yeah,4
"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?",4
"Tonight, I'm gonna dance",4
This is the last time I'm asking you why,4
And who's gonna hold you like me?,4
Nobody,4
"(Say) Say, ""(Don't) don't (Go) go""",4
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew,4
I was enchanted to meet you,4
"No, nothing good starts in a getaway car",4
"So scarlet, it was maroon",4
'Cause you were never mine,4
Why you gotta be so mean?,4
Last time I'm asking you this,4
"Oh, yeah",4
"(Hey, hey, hey)",4
Put my name at the top of your list,4
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?,4
This is the last time I'm asking you this,4
And I'm only me when I'm with you,4
"And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for",4
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e,4
"And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah",4
Ridin' in a getaway car,4
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere,4
Please don't ever become a stranger,4
I'm only up when you're not down,4
And all at once,4
"We ain't getting through this one, babe",4
"Baby, that's the fun of you",4
"This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you",4
"Ooh, ooh, ooh",4
"Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there",4
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?,4
"But on a Wednesday in a caf√©, I watched it begin again",4
And we were happy,4
He did it,4
We were happy,4
I knew you,4
You left me no choice but to stay here forever,4
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me,4
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams,4
They say I did something bad,4
(You should be) You should be,4
Who's afraid of little old me?,4
"(Ooh, hoo, hoo)",4
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side,4
I want you back but it's come down to nothing,4
And all I have is your sympathy,4
A better man,4
"Lord, save me, my drug is my baby",4
Because you break them,4
"Breathe without you, but I have to",4
'Cause I know that it's delicate,4
Is it too soon to do this yet?,4
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate),4
Is it chill that you're in my head?,4
'Cause I like you,4
"To you, to you",4
I've still got you all over me,4
"(One, two, three, four)",4
You belong with me,4
"Brand new, full throttle",4
Fell in love when I saw you standing there,4
They'll tell you I'm insane,4
It must have been the way you kissed me,4
And that was the moment I knew,4
"Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby",4
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me,4
"And we were dancing, dancing",4
"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me",4
"Baby, let the games begin",4
Are you ready for it?,4
I'll meet you when you're out,4
"Of the church, at the back door",4
Who do I have to speak to,4
I don't wanna miss you like this,4
All this time,4
"Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one",4
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?,4
I miss you like it was the very first night,4
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time,4
I wish I could fly,4
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze,4
"No, no",4
"Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there",4
"Down the stairs, I was there, I was there",4
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream,4
(Ooh),4
Can't help it if there's no one else,4
All I know since yesterday,4
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you,4
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so,4
The whole place was dressed to the nines,4
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?,4
Is one hell of a drug,4
You'll get better soon,4
You need to calm down,4
Little did you know your home's really only,4
"Long story short, it was a bad time",4
"And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time",4
"'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style",4
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing,4
Sometimes to run is the brave thing,4
Sometimes walking out is the one thing,4
Is everything has changed,4
"Mmm, I can't help myself",4
Everything is wrong,4
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland,4
"No sound, it's all around",4
"Ooh, ooh",4
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?,4
You remember it all,4
I didn't know you were keeping count,4
And there's nothing like a mad woman,4
"Oh, I can't",4
Forever winter if you go,4
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,4
And I know it's long gone and,4
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life,4
"My house of stone, your ivy grows",4
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time,4
Everyone's up to something,4
"He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain",4
"He wanted a bride, I was making my own name",4
"You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)",4
"Chasing that fame, he stayed the same",4
"You are in love, true love, you are in love",4
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings,4
"You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me",4
"(Red, red, red; red, red, red)",4
Say you'll remember me,4
"When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe",4
"And by mornin', gone was any trace of you",4
Catastrophic blues,4
Over and over,4
It hits different 'cause it's you,4
"What could've been, would've been",4
What should've been you,4
"It was rare, I was there",4
Movin' on was always easy for me to do,4
Stay beautiful,4
"Oh, but if it don't",4
People throw rocks at things that shine,4
"And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)",4
"Starin' at the sunset, babe",4
When I walk in the room,4
It hits different,4
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,4
When you come back down,4
Best believe I'm still bejeweled,4
Shit my friends say to get me by,4
Say you'll see me again,4
"Oh, my, love is a lie",4
Red lips and rosy cheeks,4
"And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows",4
Karma's a relaxing thought,4
And I don't think we can solve them,4
You're in the kitchen humming,4
I wish you would come back,4
When you think Tim McGraw,4
"You're on your own, kid",4
These hands had to let it go free and,4
"I'll follow you, follow you home",4
"This love came back to me, oh",4
Yeah,4
You know it used to be mad love,4
So take a look what you've done,4
"Uh-uh, uh, uh",4
"It's you and me, that's my whole world",4
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this,4
"Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I",4
I'll never forget you as long as I live and I,4
I gotta have you,4
"I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings",4
Outside they're push and shoving,4
"Wherever you stray, I follow",4
"The more that you say, the less I know",4
"Sweet like honey, karma is a cat",3
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever),3
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart,3
"Any promises now, can we, babe?",3
We can't make,3
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream,3
You must like me for me...,3
"My reputation's never been worse, so",3
But can you feel this magic in the air?,3
This ain't for the best,3
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow,3
"If it's all in my head, tell me now",3
"This love is alive back from the dead, oh",3
But I'm feelin' twenty-two,3
"""Who's afraid of little old me?""",3
But you can make me a drink,3
I know my love should be celebrated,3
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me,3
Smile at me and ask me how I've been,3
Standing there in my party dress,3
So it's gonna be forever,3
But you tolerate it,3
And it was like slow motion,3
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street,3
Missed me if you don't want me again,3
"So why don't you, don't you?",3
Me and karma vibe like that,3
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat,3
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground,3
"Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby",3
Or it's gonna go down in flames?,3
"When you are young, they assume you know nothing",3
'Cause you know I love the players,3
"But I've got a blank space, baby",3
"That's when, when I see your face",3
"That's when, when it's sunny or storming",3
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?,3
But I know I miss you,3
"I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything",3
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could,3
They said the end is coming,3
And I'll write your name,3
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did,3
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark,3
We showed 'em all up,3
"When it was good, baby, it was good, baby",3
If you would've been the one,3
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan,3
"You will take the long way, you will take the long way down",3
Under someone's bed,3
But it would've been fun,3
"In my defense, I have none",3
You put me on and said I was your favorite,3
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing,3
"Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me",3
Da-da da-da,3
"This love is good, this love is bad",3
"And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""",3
"Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""",3
I've been spending the last eight months,3
How's your heart after breakin' mine?,3
"It just felt so good, good",3
If the high was worth the pain,3
Stained glass windows in my mind,3
And don't you leave 'cause I know,3
Karma is a god,3
Do you wish you could still touch her?,3
You're so gorgeous,3
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh,3
Jump then fall,3
Jump then fall into me,3
"Baby, I'm never gonna leave you",3
Say that you wanna be with me too,3
'Cause I'ma stay through it all,3
So jump then fall,3
When she said it was too much?,3
It's just a question,3
"I know that it's over, I don't need your",3
"It was rare, you remember it",3
"And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey",3
All of me changed like midnight,3
No other sadness in the world would do,3
"But, honestly, baby, who's counting?",3
Scratches down your back now,3
"Come here, dressed in black now",3
"I think he did it, but I just can't prove it",3
Don't want no other shade of blue but you,3
"But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?",3
"But you know there is a ""me""",3
Lately I've been dressin' for revenge,3
"(I wish you would, I wish you would)",3
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground,3
"'Til you put me down, oh",3
"No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh",3
"In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh",3
She is here to destroy you,3
Should've known I'd be the first to leave,3
Flew me to places I'd never been,3
"I wish you would, I wish you would",3
Don't pretend it's such a mystery,3
I promise that you'll never find another like,3
"It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone",3
You're the only one of you,3
"(I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)",3
You'll find that you were never not mine,3
I'll make you wanna think twice,3
"I, I hear the whispers in your e-e-eyes",3
"Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet",3
Whether I'm gonna be your wife or,3
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die,3
"Oh-oh, oh-oh",3
But loving him was red,3
"Don't get sad, get even",3
In red lipstick,3
So put me in the basement,3
And when I meet the band,3
"They ask, ""Do you have a man?""",3
"I could still say, ""I don't remember""",3
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles,3
"Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""",3
"Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more",3
"It was the best night, never would forget how he moved",3
All I need is on the other side of the door,3
Familiarity breeds contempt,3
When I want the penthouse of your heart,3
"Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar",3
Diamonds in my eyes,3
"Wildest dreams, ah, ha",3
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry,3
"I'm setting off, but not without my muse",3
Time slows down,3
We would've been timeless,3
We would have been timeless,3
"In your wildest dreams, ah, ha",3
With no one to impress,3
I can still make the whole place shimmer,3
Who's desperately in love with you,3
"Come on, come on, little taste of heaven",3
Just know I'm right here hoping,3
So on the weekends,3
"You know I'm not a bad girl, but I",3
Promise to be dazzling,3
"I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you",3
Lipstick on your face,3
But I don't wanna go there anymore,3
And I was catching my breath,3
Standin' in a nice dress,3
I'll leave my window open,3
That you'll come in with the rain,3
"I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl",3
And I couldn't be sure,3
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you,3
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night,3
Even if it's just in your,3
"Baby, I'm the one to be",3
"Ditch the clowns, get the crown",3
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team,3
"So dim that spotlight, tell me things like",3
I had a feeling so peculiar,3
Everything will be alright if,3
We ditch the whole scene,3
We could call it even,3
The lips I used to call home,3
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks,3
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,3
"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little",3
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all,3
Long live the walls we crashed through,3
The mark they saw on my collarbone,3
I bent the truth too far tonight,3
Put on your headphones and burn my city,3
Your picket fence is sharp as knives,3
The rust that grew between telephones,3
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?,3
Why'd you have to (Why'd you have to),3
"Like snow, ah",3
"We are never, ever, ever getting back together",3
"You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you",3
"(Say, say, say, say)",3
"You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you",3
"Now your silence has me screamin', screamin'",3
Just to leave me in the night?,3
"Walk away and leave me bleedin', bleedin'?",3
Why'd you have to twist the knife?,3
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?),3
When you splashed your wine into me,3
And bring on all the pretenders,3
August slipped away into a moment in time,3
"That's what people say, mm-mm",3
"No, I didn't see the news",3
'Cause we were somewhere else,3
"Like we were in Paris, oh",3
"I might just die, it would make no difference",3
(Why you gotta be so mean?),3
"'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play",3
Everything comes out teenage petulance,3
You know that my train could take you home,3
Anywhere else is hollow,3
Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room,3
Tying you to me?,3
"One day, we will be remembered",3
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate,3
When it all broke down,3
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now,3
Invisible string,3
All along there was some,3
Was holy ground,3
And right there where we stood,3
Never looking down,3
The burgundy on my t-shirt,3
And isn't it just so pretty to think,3
But I can see us lost in the memory,3
'Cause it was never mine,3
"Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up",3
"And now that I know, I wish you left me wondering",3
"I'm the problem, it's me",3
"I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror",3
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero,3
Can't breathe whenever you're gone,3
And I damn sure would've never danced with the devil,3
"At 19, and the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven",3
"And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts",3
"(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back",3
"Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy",3
Memories feel like weapons,3
But every night with us is like a dream,3
"(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay",3
"Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me",3
"Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly",3
"Baby, we're the new romantics",3
"It's alright, just wait and see",3
The best people in life are free,3
Who you are is not where you've been,3
I miss who I used to be,3
I keep on waiting for a sign,3
The wound won't close,3
"I can't let this go, I fight with you in my sleep",3
Out of all the bricks they threw at me,3
"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind",3
"This night is sparklin', don't you let it go",3
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes,3
"I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home",3
But it's coming down,3
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets,3
August sipped away like a bottle of wine,3
Tonight feels impossible,3
I never imagined we'd end like this,3
I never thought we'd have a last kiss,3
How to be somethin' you miss,3
All that I know is I don't know,3
I touched you for only a fortnight,3
I might as well be drunk in love,3
On the playground won't make you many friends,3
Stars by the pocketful,3
"Five seconds later, I'm fastenin' myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah",3
"I think there's been a glitch, uh-yeah",3
"Uh-huh, uh",3
"Weird, but fucking beautiful",3
A million little times,3
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,3
He was a moth to the flame,3
"She was holding the matches, woah",3
"Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys",3
Like snow on the beach (Snow on the beach),3
Fuck it if I can't have us,3
You keep me next to you,3
"And I want you now, wanna need you forever",3
My hand was the one you reached for,3
I wanna be your end game (End game),3
That old familiar body ache,3
"You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend",3
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like,3
All throughout the Great War,3
Always remember,3
You made her like that,3
"In the heat of your electric touch, mmm",3
"Big reputation, big reputation",3
No one likes a mad woman,3
You are the best thing that's ever been mine,3
"Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain",3
What a shame she went mad,3
"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down",3
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around,3
"Now, pretty baby",3
"(He was chaos, he was revelry)",3
All I know is you held the door,3
Everything has changed,3
All I know is a simple name,3
And your eyes look like coming home,3
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team),3
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,3
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,3
"They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run",3
But I'll bet you want to,3
Twenty-two,3
And I could see you up against the wall with me,3
And the first night that you saw me,3
"I laid the groundwork, and then",3
And now you're mine,3
'Cause I'm a mastermind,3
"I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I",3
The tomb won't close,3
You always have been,3
"Ah-ah, ah-ah",3
It feels like one of those nights,3
And it always leads to you and my hometown,3
"And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her",3
If they only had a chance to love her,3
I'm stayin' at my parents' house,3
Can I use you up?,3
And all the bad boys would be good boys,3
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town,3
"'Cause I, I know places we can hide",3
" 'Tis the damn season, write this down",3
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes,3
"I just wanna know you, know you, know you",3
The rain came pourin' down,3
I'm a mirrorball,3
I've got a lot to live without,3
"Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye",3
Look at how my tears ricochet,3
You were bigger than the whole sky,3
You were more than just a short time,3
I remember,3
Surreal,3
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say,3
The 1950s shit they want from me,3
And I've got a lot to pine about,3
Oh,3
You shoulda known,3
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace,3
I'm never gonna meet,3
"What could've been, would've been you",3
"Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city",3
And I hope you know that,3
"Every time I don't, I almost do, I almost do",3
But this love is ours,3
"The stakes are high, the water's rough",3
Get it off your chest,3
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship),3
And life makes love look hard,3
"Cursing my name, wishing I stayed",3
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home,3
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two),3
"No, I'm not, but you should see your faces",3
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you,3
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine,3
I go back to December all the time,3
And I didn't like the ending,3
I'll be right here on the ground,3
"In the middle of the night, in my dreams",3
I-Island breeze and lights down low,3
Touch me and you'll never be alone,3
"I, I, I see how this is gon' go",3
And I watch superman fly away,3
"Go save the world, I'll be around",3
And I wish I could run to you,3
You've got a busy day today,3
Don't wait or say a single vow,3
You need to hear me out,3
I watch superman fly away,3
"And they said, ""Speak now""",3
"Screamin', ""But Daddy, I love him",3
And I just wanna tell you,3
Uh-huh,3
It takes everything in me not to call you,3
"Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone",3
"Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple",3
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end,3
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears,3
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand,3
But nothing at twenty-two?,3
Takes one to know one,3
"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference",3
So peaceful and quiet,3
And it was so nice,3
"Taking mine, but it's been promised to another",3
"Oh, goddamn",3
"This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)",3
It hits different this time,3
"And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't",3
"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on",3
"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know",3
Lost again with no surprises,3
"This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe",3
Asking God if he could play it again,3
How can a person know everything at eighteen,3
And when I got home 'fore I said amen,3
"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day",3
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,3
I've never been anywhere cold as you,3
"Darling, you're the one I want, and",3
"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""",3
"Darling, you're the one I want",3
"Oh, you're the one I want",3
"And we know it's never simple, never easy",3
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not,3
Chandelier's still flickering here,3
Even though we boarded them up,3
I look through the windows of this love,3
I look in people's windows,3
"I get drunk, but it's not enough",3
Help me hold on to you,3
"I've been the archer, I've been the prey",3
I'm never gonna love again,3
About if they can redo the prophecy?,3
Change the prophecy,3
Don't want money,3
Just someone who wants my company,3
Let it once be me,3
"I keep singing, don't know why I do...",3
He's the song in the car,3
My baby's fly like a jet stream,3
"You really blew this, babe",3
High above the whole scene,3
And if I didn't know better,3
Loves me like I'm brand new,3
"'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home",3
If I didn't know better,3
I'd think you were still around,3
I've been on my knees,3
I had a bad feeling,3
And there is happiness,3
"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)",3
Please,3
And it gets colder and colder,3
"Disappointments, close your eyes",3
I bet you think about me,3
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me,3
"Yes, I remember what you said last night",3
Here's to you and your temper,3
But who could stay?,3
I'm the one he's walking to,3
"Come on, baby, with me",3
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go,3
Walking with his head down,3
My baby's fit like a daydream,3
So how can I ever try to be better?,3
Nobody ever lets me in,3
I won't pick up the phone,3
You're beautiful,3
Now it's too late for you and your white horse,3
And when you find everything you looked for,3
Ask anyone,3
You're really gonna be someone,3
And don't you know,3
"Every little piece, love",3
"But ooh, whoa oh",3
"And it's ooh, whoa oh",3
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend,3
Carve your name into my bedpost,3
I hate it here,3
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here,3
"And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name",3
No rules in breakable heaven,3
'Cause you could be the one that I love,3
"And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away",3
I could be the one that you dream of,3
"Forever and ever, ah",3
Can we always be this close?,3
Can I go where you go?,3
For you,3
Wilder and lighter,3
"You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me",3
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet,3
"You could be the one that I keep, and",3
"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""",3
"And I should've been there, in the back of your mind",3
Get back to me (Get back to me),3
"You should've said, ""No""",3
You should've gone home,3
I'm all about you,3
"It's cool, that's what I tell 'em",3
"It's blue, the feeling I've got",3
"I can still see you, this ain't the best view",3
"""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""",3
Ended with the slam of a door,3
"The water's high, you're jumping into it",3
"Hold on, baby, you're losing it",3
"You already know, babe",3
But it always ends up with a town car speeding,3
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can,3
Pushed from the precipice,3
Then came out alive,3
Right down the rabbit hole,3
Started with a kiss,3
I've never been on the outside,3
I've been a lot of lonely places,3
"Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again",3
On the outside looking in,3
"You belong with me, you belong with me",3
'Cause you have to,3
"Been here all along, so why can't you see?",3
Now I'm all about you,3
"I'm all about you, ah",3
And letting go and no one knows,3
I write this in the sky,3
That you might not be the golden one,3
All her fuckin' lives,3
And you're tied together with a smile,3
"Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah",3
But you're coming undone,3
Flashed before her eyes,3
It feels like the time,3
I had to take them away,3
I don't want you like a best friend,3
She fell through the ice,3
Who could stay?,3
"You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her'd",3
"Body and soul, ooh whoa",3
When you think happiness,3
I hope you think of me,3
I'm the one who burned us down,3
And my old faded blue jeans,3
Think of my head on your chest,3
"Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates",3
I hope you think that little black dress,3
"Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)",3
"As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn",3
"I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)",3
There is happiness,3
We could be a beautiful,3
You're gonna believe them,3
"I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go",3
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you,3
"So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst",3
"I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)",3
And tried to tell the town,3
Don't read the last page,3
I can't find a pulse,3
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day,3
"You said, ""No one else""",3
Too young to know it gets better,3
You know I love a London boy,3
"Hey, it's all me, in my head",3
I want your midnights,3
If you weren't around,3
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this,3
Do you believe me now?,3
Voted most likely to run away with you,3
But never to keep,3
I'll be summer sun for you forever,3
Meet me in the afterglow,3
Miracle,3
She don't even know you,3
And you can tell me that you're sorry,3
All this time I didn't know,3
"But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before",3
You were breaking down,3
Promises oceans deep,3
"And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go",3
Instead of just invisible,3
Breaking down and coming undone,3
Unbelievable,3
But it's not what I meant,3
"You're alive, you're alive in my head",3
"He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet",3
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay),3
I'd fall to pieces on the floor,3
This is the last straw,3
I hope you think my favorite song,3
It's a rollercoaster kind of rush,3
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying,3
'Cause you're losin' me,3
And I never knew I could feel that much,3
Words from the mouths of babes,3
"You're alive, so alive",3
But as she was leaving,2
Wish he wouldn't be sore,2
"Hey, that's my man",2
It felt like breathing,2
I still got love for you,2
Just try to never grow up,2
And though I can't recall your face,2
"In New York, no shoes",2
That's my man,2
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art,2
Out the drive one evening,2
I just wanna show you,2
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah),2
"I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah",2
"And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry, blood moonlit",2
It must be counterfeit,2
"(Talk to me) But we are never, ever, ever, ever",2
"Your name, forever the name on my lips",2
Perched in the dark,2
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear,2
Flying in a dream,2
And I will hold on to you,2
Like it could be love,2
"I would stay forever if you (Say) say, ""(Don't) don't (Go) go,"" woah",2
Won't let no one break your heart,2
Then he'll call her a whore,2
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes,2
Passed down like folk songs,2
I could be the way forward,2
"Please, don't be in love with someone else",2
You wanting me,2
Sweet tea in the summer,2
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush,2
"We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)",2
You're a bandit like me,2
For all that we've been through,2
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor,2
I'm drunk in the back of the car,2
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh),2
"Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true",2
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you,2
"And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid",2
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby,2
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,2
But I keep cruisin',2
There's glitter on the floor after the party,2
It's like I got this music in my mind,2
"Sayin', ""It's gonna be alright""",2
Eyes full of stars,2
We were somewhere else,2
Hustling for the good life,2
Like we were somewhere else,2
"And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate",2
I was taken by the view,2
"In a morning warning, no one heard",2
Make believe it's champagne,2
"Stumbled down pretend alleyways, cheap wine",2
You can mark my words that I said it first,2
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul,2
Were there clues I didn't see?,2
"Yes, we were somewhere else",2
"I'm reachin' for you, terrified",2
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us,2
"Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""",2
"But you won't, but you won't, but you won't",2
The one I was dancing with,2
"Woo, woo, woo",2
"But we are never, ever, ever, ever",2
"Oh my, my, my, my",2
"Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes",2
"This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you",2
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?,2
Forever the name on my lips,2
Only if they pay for it,2
"(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Once I fix me",2
"(Oh-oh, oh-oh) He's gonna miss me",2
"I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""",2
Put on your records and regret me,2
Now that we don't talk,2
You won't remember all my,2
You said I was freeloading,2
"Rain soaking, blind hoping",2
"Wound open, game token",2
"Lock broken, slur spoken",2
"Gleaming, twinkling",2
Eyes like sinking ships on waters,2
"So inviting, I almost jump in",2
Feelin' like a face in the crowd,2
"Call a cab, lose my number",2
The slowest way is never loving them enough,2
In the front seat of his car,2
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)",2
"And I'm only me, who I wanna be",2
I don't wanna live without you,2
And I know everything about you,2
Everything I need is right here by my side,2
Just listen to the crickets sing,2
And sometimes we don't say a thing,2
When I'm with anybody else,2
Just like all those times before,2
But you're going to,2
But I shine so bright,2
It's so hard to be myself,2
And only you can tell,2
That I'm only up when you're not down,2
"Well, I'm only me when I'm with you",2
You say that you can't live without me,2
"You should find another guiding light, guiding light",2
"Uh-huh, yeah",2
I wake up screaming from dreaming,2
She can't see the way your eyes,2
Love to think you'll never forget,2
"One day, I'll watch as you're leaving",2
You and I are painting pictures in the sky,2
"Stay, stay, stay, stay!",2
"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey",2
(For the last time),2
In a field behind your yard,2
Light up when you smile,2
"She's an actress, woah",2
She's not a saint and she's not what you think,2
I laughed in your face and said,2
"Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors",2
"Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you",2
And I don't try to hide my tears,2
My secrets or my deepest fears,2
Just you and me,2
Through it all nobody gets me like you do,2
People like you always want back,2
"I touched you, I touched you",2
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true,2
Living in a crazy world,2
And right before your eyes,2
"Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her",2
"You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye",2
'Nother fortnight lost in America,2
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?,2
"Move to Florida, buy the car you want",2
It was maroon,2
And you know everything about me,2
You left your typewriter at my apartment,2
'Til you sometimes ask about the weather,2
Straight from the tortured poets department,2
And I wake with your memory over me,2
"And for a fortnight, there we were, forever running",2
Just a small-town boy and girl,2
And if I'm gonna be drunk,2
You know it might be worth it for once,2
"Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""",2
Friday night beneath the stars,2
I have a lot of regrets about that,2
And that's the thing about illicit affairs,2
You and I walk a fragile line,2
Thirty-two and still growing up now,2
Who you are is not what you did,2
"I would stay forever if you (Say) say, ""(Don't) don't (Go) go""",2
"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""",2
God rest my soul,2
Our song is the way you laugh,2
But if you only knew me,2
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know,2
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,2
"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window",2
Our song is the slamming screen door,2
It's death by a thousand cuts,2
I have known it all this time,2
And you just see right through me,2
(Ooh-ooh),2
"Oh, holding my breath",2
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby,2
I would've stayed on my knees,2
Something's gone terribly wrong,2
You're all I wanted,2
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone,2
And every day is like a battle,2
"Would've, could've, should've",2
Flashbacks waking me up,2
"'Cause baby, I could build a castle",2
Crestfallen on the landing,2
"It's okay, life is a tough crowd",2
And even though you want to,2
"""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith",2
"I would stay forever if you say, ""Don't go""",2
"This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots""",2
"How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)",2
No-fucking-body,2
"(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)",2
Just never grow up,2
"Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho",2
You break my heart in the blink of an eye,2
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch,2
"Oh, I don't wanna grow up",2
Wish I'd never grown up,2
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo,2
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know,2
But I think that it's best if we both stay,2
Dorothea (Ah-ah),2
At least I'm trying,2
Why'd you have to lead me on?,2
Why'd you whisper in the dark?,2
She's never gonna love you like I want to,2
"I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)",2
I forgot that you,2
"Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh",2
I break down every time you call,2
Your mom's ring in your pocket,2
"We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball",2
"They say, ""I don't know""",2
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright,2
"At teatime, everybody agrees",2
I was cryin' in a getaway car,2
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling,2
He's so tall and handsome as hell,2
Saw you comin',2
And I never (I never),2
"If your cascade, ocean wave blues come",2
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm,2
It hits different (It hits different),2
Drew looks at me,2
I fake a smile so he won't see,2
We would've been,2
You could stay,2
How's one to know?,2
I see right through me,2
They see right through,2
They see right through me,2
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,2
"I polish up real, I polish up real nice",2
"He's so bad, but he does it so well",2
All these people think love's for show,2
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing,2
But I would die for you in secret,2
Unless you play it good and right,2
Love is a ruthless game,2
This is the worthwhile fight,2
This is a state of grace,2
"Be the same (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)",2
"And I'll never (I'll never, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)",2
"Saw you comin' (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)",2
"And I never (I never, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)",2
"Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red",2
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,2
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team,2
The sight that flashed before me was your face,2
There was nothing else I could do,2
And I forget about you long enough,2
"The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me",2
Nice,2
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star,2
To forget why I needed to,2
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,2
So casually cruel in the name of being honest,2
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,2
"'Cause I remember it all, all, all",2
"Yeah, I showed up at your party",2
"They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl""",2
"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it",2
"Down the block, there's an antique shop",2
"I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it",2
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,2
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,2
"Who could ever leave me, darling",2
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,2
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,2
I want you for worse or for better,2
I would wait forever and ever,2
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight),2
I would've read your love letters every single night,2
"Running scared, I was there",2
And we danced all night,2
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,2
"Down the stairs, I was there",2
Maybe I asked for too much,2
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece,2
You'll see me in hindsight,2
Tangled up with you all night,2
And you can try to change my mind,2
I bet these memories,2
But you might have to wait in line,2
'Til you tore it all up,2
"Someday, when you leave me",2
"(I see right through me, I see right through me)",2
"So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine",2
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this,2
"Wind in my hair, I was there",2
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me,2
'Cause there we are again on that little town street,2
My heart won't start anymore,2
"And I just think you should, think you should know",2
Your name has echoed through my mind,2
"And I will get you, get you alone",2
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night,2
"I counted days, I counted miles",2
"We could follow the sparks, I'll drive",2
"Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh",2
"Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)",2
"'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey",2
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat),2
"To see you there, to see you there",2
This path is reckless,2
(Stop 'cause you're losin' me),2
Can I ask you a question?,2
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room,2
That nothing safe is worth the drive,2
"And I would follow you, follow you home",2
This hope is treacherous,2
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days,2
"I said, ""That's a lie""",2
We're a crooked love in a straight line down,2
"Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me",2
"Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)",2
I wish we could go back,2
And remember what we were fightin' for and I,2
I miss you too much to be mad anymore and I,2
The moon like a spotlight on the lake,2
The one we danced to all night long,2
"You always knew how to push my buttons (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)",2
I guess sometimes we all get,2
"You give me everything and nothin' (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)",2
"This mad, mad love makes you come runnin' (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)",2
"To stand back where you stood (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)",2
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you,2
Then what did you do?,2
I don't dress for friends,2
"They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)",2
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house,2
"And you've still got it in your drawer, even now",2
"Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze",2
"We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate",2
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,2
And I can picture it after all these days,2
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met,2
My only one,2
Losing him was blue like I'd never known,2
That magic's not here no more,2
"And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all",2
"I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans",2
"I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends",2
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive,2
He got that boyish look that I like in a man,2
"Stood on the cliffside screaming, ""Give me a reason""",2
"Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)",2
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in,2
Wanna see what's under that attitude like,2
"Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh",2
The whole school is rolling fake dice,2
"You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes",2
"It's you and me, there's nothing like this",2
From when they pulled me apart,2
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars,2
"We're so sad, we paint the town blue",2
You and I,2
Skipping down 16th Avenue,2
My heart won't start anymore for you,2
"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold",2
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow,2
"Oh, it's so sad to",2
Think about the good times,2
"Broke your heart, I'll put it back together",2
"That's how you get the girl, girl, oh",2
"That's how you get the girl, girl",2
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend,2
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life,2
"You're the one I want, one I want",2
"Just one time, just one time",2
If we survived the Great War,2
"""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""",2
"And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry",2
I say casually in the car,2
"La, la, la, la, la, la",2
"And run, like you'd run from the law",2
"Darling, let's run",2
What about that?,2
"Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy",2
Run from it all,2
"Uh-huh, uh-huh",2
"Go where no one else is, run",2
"In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams",2
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst,2
"So give me a reason and don't say no, no",2
"Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love",2
I want your dreary Mondays,2
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down,2
I search the party of better bodies,2
"Wrap your arms around me, baby boy",2
We won't be sleepin',2
You look like bad news,2
"Baby (Baby), I know places we won't be found",2
"The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah",2
And they'll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down,2
I know places,2
"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone",2
And you find something to wrap your noose around,2
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out,2
"All that blood shed, crimson clover",2
"Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)",2
(Ah-ah-ah),2
I want to drive away with you,2
"And what it cost, now that we don't talk",2
Don't you worry your pretty little mind,2
"Ooh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'?",2
I felt your arms twistin' around me,2
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night,2
"And we pretended it could last forever, eh",2
"I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""",2
"And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth",2
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh),2
And I snuck in through the garden gate,2
So don't you worry your pretty little mind,2
"And life was never worse, but never better, eh, eh",2
"It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""",2
"And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake",2
"Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break",2
"Shake it off, I shake it off",2
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?,2
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?",2
"Way to go, tiger",2
"I always forget to tell you, ""I love you""",2
"I bet this time of night, you're still up",2
I bet you're tired from a long hard week,2
Think I'm finally clean,2
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window,2
"Come back, I'll be with you someday",2
I hope your life will lead you back to my door,2
I vowed I would always be yours,2
Higher and higher,2
'Cause we survived the Great War,2
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me,2
"You're my, my, my, my lover",2
And you started it,2
"Didn't they tell us, ""Don't rush into things""?",2
You started it,2
I want your complications too,2
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man,2
You can't get rid of it,2
"And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down",2
My castle's crumbling down,2
(Ayy),2
And now I'm covered in you,2
If I told you it was just a summer thing?,2
"In the garden, would you trust me",2
Or lead me to the garden?,2
Would you tell me to go fuck myself,2
Would you have me? Would you want me?,2
But if I just showed up at your party,2
Was what I did to you,2
The worst thing that I ever did,2
"Most times, but this time it was true",2
You can't believe a word she says,2
You heard the rumors from Inez,2
Sorry for not making you my centerfold,2
"Uh-uh, uh-uh",2
It feels like a perfect night,2
"Down the stairs, you were there",2
('Cause it's you),2
It's coming back around,2
And I keep my side of the street clean,2
You wouldn't know what I mean,2
'Cause karma is my boyfriend,2
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend,2
"I bet you think about me, yes",2
"'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah",2
"You will never learn your lesson""",2
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so,2
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,2
"Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world",2
"Wind in my hair, you were there",2
"Combat, I'm ready for combat",2
Oh I'm just a girl,2
You don't wanna know me now,2
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down,2
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again,2
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again),2
It seems like one of those nights,2
That I can see you,2
What if I told you none of it was accidental?,2
'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me,2
What would you do if we never made a sound?,2
What would you do if they never found us out?,2
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?,2
Nothing was gonna stop me,2
Just like clockwork,2
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?,2
"Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out",2
"(This love) This love came back to me, oh",2
And some things you just can't speak about,2
"'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man",2
(Hey),2
Only twenty minutes to sleep,2
But you dream of some epiphany,2
"(This love, this love, this love, this love)",2
But now that we're done and it's over,2
"In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams",2
"The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go",2
And I bet you think about me,2
Wondering where did my baby go?,2
"It's time, oh-oh",2
I don't know about you,2
You don't know about me,2
And now I'm covered,2
We just keep dancin' like we're,2
To make some sense of what you've seen,2
Just one single glimpse of relief,2
"What would you do? Baby, if you only knew",2
"I could see you, make me want you even more",2
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor,2
Blood's thick but nothing like a payroll,2
"I call, just checking up on him",2
Like you were in this room,2
"Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here",2
"You know how to ball, I know Aristotle",2
In the middle of the night,2
"Truth, dare, spin bottles",2
'Cause I'm a real tough kid,2
I can handle my shit,2
"They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did",2
But no amount of freedom gets you clean,2
"God knows, too long, and wasted time",2
Swaying as the room burned down,2
"Held out, and held on",2
"Lights, camera, bitch, smile",2
You haven't met the new me yet,2
"Breaking down, I hit the floor",2
"All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""",2
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin',2
I was hittin' my marks,2
"All this time how could you not know, baby?",2
Standing by and waiting at your back door,2
There is an indentation in the shape of you,2
"It's true, swear, scouts honor",2
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers,2
"Hello, Mr. ""Casually cruel""",2
"Quick, quick, tell me something awful",2
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time,2
"Hello, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""",2
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you,2
"I guess you never know, never know",2
"You can tell me when it's over, mm",2
"All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting",2
And I would've been so happy,2
And watch you tolerate it,2
"Ha, ah, ah",2
My hands are shaking from holding back from you,2
"All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation",2
"You knew what you wanted, and, boy, you got her",2
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart,2
"I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day",2
"I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art",2
"(Yeah, I want you)",2
"And I don't even want you back, I just want to know",2
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal,2
"And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give",2
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?,2
"I'm sinking, our fingers entwined",2
And in a blink of a crinkling eye,2
"But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time",2
"Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time",2
"I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined",2
"I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!",2
Still worship this love,2
"It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend",2
"Long story short, I survived",2
I'd hold you as the water rushes in,2
"I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you",2
Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights,2
I could show you incredible things,2
I'm trying to stifle my sighs,2
"And I can't breathe without you, but I have to",2
"Your friends are around, so be quiet",2
I'm watching American Pie with you on a Saturday night,2
Been a sweet 16 suddenly,2
"Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm",2
Isn't it?,2
The brink of a wrinkle in time,2
From smoking your jokes all damn night,2
And they're all laughing,2
I'll drink what you think and I'm high,2
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me,2
Whenever you're around,2
"Never a clean break, no one here to save me",2
But there was one thing missing,2
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,2
Isn't it delicate?,2
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye,2
Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy,2
My hands are shaking from all this,2
There is a glorious sunrise,2
They all warned us about times like this,2
"That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale",2
"I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell",2
They say I did something bad (Oh),2
"Laughing, when I'm crying",2
"This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town",2
When I wake up in the morning,2
"They shake their heads sayin', ""God, help her""",2
When I tell 'em he's my man,2
But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger,2
"I can fix him, no, really, I can",2
And only I can,2
I sit and watch you,2
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one,2
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,2
"In our history, across our great divide",2
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy,2
But I knew you,2
Now I wake up by your side,2
This is how the world works,2
I can feel the flames on my skin,2
"I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean",2
"""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""",2
"From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind",2
"Well, you should be",2
You should be (You should be),2
And I said,2
No more keepin' score,2
Then why's it feel so good?,2
But why's it feel so good?,2
Most fun I ever had,2
Oh-oh-oh,2
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm),2
Dappled with the flickers of light,2
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid,2
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair,2
You're lovin' me,2
Never quite buried,2
"It'll leave you breathless, mm",2
We'll take this way too far,2
You said I'm the love of your life,2
Lay the table with the fancy shit,2
And you love the game,2
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child,2
"People need a key to get to, the only one is mine",2
I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind,2
For never leaving well enough alone,2
Say my name and everything just stops,2
It would've been you,2
And if my wishes came true,2
"Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool",2
"But we were something, don't you think so?",2
"I get so high, oh!",2
Or with a nasty scar,2
"Still alive, killing time at the cemetery",2
Use my best colors for your portrait,2
"Help, I'm still at the restaurant",2
To come around,2
Glass shattered on the white cloth,2
They say the road gets hard and you get lost,2
"When you're led by blind faith, blind faith",2
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday,2
But we might just get away with it,2
Religion's in your lips,2
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch,2
We'd still worship,2
We might just get away with it,2
The altar is my hips,2
"They say, ""What a sad sight""",2
Cross-legged in the dim light,2
Still sitting in a corner I haunt,2
"If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary",2
It's happening again,2
I'd kiss you as the lights went out,2
And it was always the same searing pain,2
"And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting",2
"Come back, be here",2
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name,2
"And I'll tell you one thing, honey",2
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there),2
Whether I'm gonna curse you out or,2
"Take you back to my house, I haven't decided yet",2
"Ooh whoa, ooh whoa",2
(You're mine),2
(Now I'm wide awake),2
Just say you've always wondered,2
If you wanna tear my world apart,2
"Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""",2
"Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh",2
"Baby, that's the fun of me",2
I'm the only one of me,2
"Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh",2
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain,2
Can you feel it now?,2
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down,2
"This revolution, the time will come",2
And I'm so furious,2
And I don't wanna need you this way,2
But what can I say?,2
"Closure, your closure",2
"Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3",2
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?,2
"Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""",2
I can't say anything to your face (To your face),2
"'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)",2
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way),2
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have,2
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh),2
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah),2
"And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah",2
For us to finally win,2
"If you wanna break my cold, cold heart",2
"Baby doll, when it comes to a lover",2
"""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart",2
And it would be a fine proposition,2
I promise that you'll never find another like me,2
I know better,2
"So don't look at me, you got a girl at home",2
I need to say,2
Said goodbye in a getaway car,2
"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom",2
"And you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always""",2
I was dyin' in a getaway car,2
"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called",2
I see you turn off your phone,2
"And now you've got me alone, and I say",2
"They think she did it, but they just can't prove it",2
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he-,2
"Honey, when I'm above the trees",2
If I hadn't once been just like her,2
If I was a stupid girl,2
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there),2
"I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)",2
Did you forget everything?,2
"I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed",2
But I know I had the best day with you today,2
You were drivin' the getaway car,2
"We were flyin', but we'd never get far",2
Wise men once said,2
Sorry that I hurt you,2
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars,2
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars,2
There were sirens in the beat of your heart,2
And we rule the kingdom inside my room,2
Cross your thoughtless heart,2
Only liquor anoints you,2
She's the albatross,2
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat,2
"Salute to me, I'm your American queen",2
"Every time you smile, I smile",2
"And every time you shine, I'll shine for you",2
"Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby",2
Makes me run for cover when you're around,2
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you,2
Tell me why,2
These blokes warm the benches,2
We've been on a winning streak,2
"He jokes that ""It's heroin, but this time with an E""",2
Catching my death,2
"No, there ain't no doubt",2
And I had a bad feeling,2
"Like it was the first time, first time",2
'Cause we break down a little,2
I'm sick and tired of your reasons,2
"'Cause baby, I know what you know",2
We can feel it,2
And all the pieces fall right into place,2
Leave it all behind,2
All eyes on us,2
But you know you got a mean streak,2
Getting caught up in a moment,2
And I need you like a heartbeat,2
(Things will never be the same),2
(I can never look away),2
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,2
"(And now) I'm all about you, ah",2
This happens once every few lifetimes,2
I can't take my eyes off of you,2
These chemicals hit me like white wine,2
That this pain would be for,2
I haven't come around in so long,2
I'm sick and tired of your attitude,2
"So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh",2
Scream your name,2
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row,2
So when I touch down,2
"You need to calm down, you're being too loud",2
I could go back to every laugh,2
I'm not trying to exaggerate,2
Don't be afraid to,2
"You were my best four years""",2
You did a number on me,2
Don't wanna hurt anymore,2
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die,2
And this is when the feeling sinks in,2
"""Come on, baby, with me",2
I guess you're in New York today,2
You should take it as a compliment,2
I think he did it,2
I just don't understand how you don't miss me,2
"And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song",2
Old habits die screaming,2
Both of these things can be true,2
I love you to the moon and back,2
There'll be happiness after you,2
"I remember your bare feet, down the hallway",2
"(Uh-oh, uh-oh-oh-oh)",2
"It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore",2
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it,2
"The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me",2
I'm yours to keep,2
"This town is fake, but you're the real thing",2
Breath of fresh air through smoke rings,2
"Take the glory, give everything",2
Picture of your face in an invisible locket,2
And I'm yours to lose,2
"I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me",2
In the middle of the night waking from this dream,2
"Come on, come on, oh",2
We'll tell no-one,2
"But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun",2
Do bad things with you,2
The empathetic hunger descends,2
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets,2
Come one come all,2
"But don't you, don't you",2
"Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah",2
Don't you say you've,2
"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""",2
And I wake up in the middle of the night,2
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,2
I know who my first call will be to,2
Fresh out the slammer,2
I'm runnin' back home to you,2
I shoulda known,2
"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run",2
"Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?",2
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone",2
You'll be mine and I'll be yours,2
It's like I can feel time moving,2
I had a marvelous time ruining everything,2
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see,2
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?,2
And the sparks fly,2
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath,2
"'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""",2
"Stick with me, I'm your queen",2
Wanna be with you,2
Just wanna be with you,2
Hand on the throttle,2
"You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt",2
"That's just white noise, that's just my choice",2
If all you want is gray for me,2
"Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain",2
Another name goes up in lights,2
"(Fresh out the slammer, oh)",2
One more time,2
"All I know is we said, ""Hello""",2
"She had a marvelous time ruining everything""",2
But I don't like a gold rush,2
And I fell from the pedestal,2
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul,2
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?,2
You know when it's time to go,2
No deal,2
"You like the bad ones, too",2
"But it's gonna be alright, I did my time",2
"Darling, I fancy you",2
Did you think I had in me?,2
So I guess all the rumors are true,2
"Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block",2
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it,2
And so it goes,2
"And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?",2
With your hair falling into place like dominoes,2
"And you heard about me, ooh",2
"Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah",2
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs),2
In case you're at their table,2
What if your eyes looked up and met mine,2
"So, this is me swallowing my pride",2
"Me and my wild boy, and all of his wild joy",2
Looking at it now,2
And is it over now?,2
I am not the kind of girl,2
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion,2
But you are not the kind of boy,2
"Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh",2
"Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one",2
There were flashin' lights,2
"I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want",2
At least I had the decency,2
"No, I'm not coming to my senses",2
To keep my nights out of sight,2
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences,2
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs,2
And my whispered sighs,2
When it's time to go,2
"Don't say yes, run away now",2
"I'm havin' his baby""",2
Off of very tall somethings,2
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs),2
"And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no",2
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around),2
"So step right out, there is no amount",2
Of crying I can do for you,2
We always walked a very thin line,2
"You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out",2
Was it over then?,2
And I go back to December all the time,2
"In your dream as you passed out, baby",2
"And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one",2
Thought I caught lightning in a bottle,2
So please show me Hackney,2
"But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?",2
"Oh, but it's gone again",2
"I go back to December, turn around and make it alright",2
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street,2
You ain't gotta pray for me,2
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?,2
"La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la",2
"I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time",2
"You should see the things we do, baby",2
Pad around when I get home,2
"Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""",2
"I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind",2
No one has to know,2
I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope,2
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?,2
A greater woman wouldn't beg,2
"""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear",2
I'll tell you somethin' right now,2
You're not my homeland anymore,2
So what am I defending now?,2
"I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be",2
I've had too much to drink tonight,2
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush,2
"I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida",2
We could just ride around,2
"Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out",2
"Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires",2
It's one hell of a drug,2
"Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable",2
We had a beautiful magic love there,2
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling",2
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman,2
"What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair",2
But she used to say she wished that you were dead,2
"I need to forget, so take me to Florida",2
I just need this love spiral,2
"Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)",2
"Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)",2
The shitstorm back in Texas,2
Down bad (Like I lost my twin),2
So you pack your life away just to wait out,2
I want you to know,2
(Are we out of the woods?),2
"So, they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say",2
You left me,2
Like we're made of starlight,2
Get it off my desk,2
"And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand",2
"Walk past, quick brush",2
"Hush, when no one is around, my dear",2
They all said nothing,2
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you,2
We were built to fall apart,2
You don't know how much I feel I love you still,2
"All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'",2
"Ah, ah, ah, ah",2
You should be,2
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes,2
"Hush, I know they said the end is near",2
"Screamed ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky, as the blood was gushin'",2
But I can't forget the way you made me heal,2
Never thought I'd meet you here,2
It could be love,2
We could be the way forward,2
And I know I'll pay for it,2
"I might just not get up, I might stay",2
Down bad,2
They say home is where the heart is,2
Boys only want love if it's torture,2
"Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya",2
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes,2
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,2
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind),2
"""There goes the last great American dynasty",2
"Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?",2
I didn't come here to make friends,2
This is why we can't have nice things,2
But I ain't tryna play,2
We might still be in love,2
I wanna be your first string (First string),2
You would've been the one,2
"Long story short, it was the wrong guy",2
"Yes, yes, I can see it now",2
"Thank you, Aimee",2
"Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been",2
"When you hold me, it holds me together",2
And they said,2
You put your arm around me for the first time,2
Talk your talk and go viral,2
"'Cause fuck it, I was in love",2
We were born to be suburban legends,2
And I say to you...,2
So you work your life away just to pay,2
"When the first stone's thrown, they're screaming",2
Clung to the nearest lips,2
"In the streets, there's a raging riot",2
"When it's ""Burn the bitch,"" they're shrieking",2
Drinking on a beach with you all over me,2
"When the truth comes out, it's quiet",2
Like the other girls do,2
And I remember thinkin',2
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever,2
"I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush",2
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying,2
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you),2
"I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be",2
"You left me no, oh, you left me no",2
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy,1
I see this for what it is,1
"Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause",1
But you were too polite to leave me,1
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died,1
"But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given",1
When we were younger down in the park,1
I see me padding across your wooden floors,1
"Honey, making a lark of the misery",1
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred,1
And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea,1
"Ooh, but you won't like it that way",1
"'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush",1
"She says, ""I think he did it, but I just can't prove it""",1
'Cause it could never be,1
"""This dorm was once a madhouse""",1
But you'll find the real thing instead,1
"She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it",1
At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit,1
It was the one place to be,1
I can't dare to dream about you anymore,1
And do you miss the rogue,1
My mind turns your life into folklore,1
"Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was",1
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya,1
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything,1
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now,1
If I pushed you to the edge?,1
That would've loved you for a lifetime,1
I think I'm gonna call him out,1
And hold your hand while dancing,1
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me,1
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?,1
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen,1
These hunters with cell phones,1
That we once walked through,1
"One for the money, two for the show",1
I never was ready so I watch you go,1
I haven't met the new me yet,1
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Garden,1
At her job or anywhere,1
He reports his missing wife,1
"And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention",1
"Oh, leave it all behind",1
Will you forgive my soul,1
And I noticed when I passed his house,1
His truck has got some brand new tires,1
But there was happiness because of you too,1
It's never too late to come back to my side,1
Sometimes you just don't know the answer,1
I was dancing when the music stopped,1
Showed you all of my hiding spots,1
And his mistress moved in,1
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you,1
You got shiny friends since you left town,1
Don't think we'll say that word again,1
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet,1
"How evergreen, our group of friends",1
"(She was with me, dude)",1
"What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said",1
Her picture in your wallet,1
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had never seen a love as pure as it,1
"At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit",1
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene,1
Haunted by the look in my eyes,1
With champagne problems,1
Never leave you standing,1
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door,1
Beyond the terror in the nightfall,1
"""She would've made such a lovely bride",1
Past the curses and cries,1
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?,1
Is just shit we're dividin' up,1
Past the blood and bruise,1
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones,1
"I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""",1
But there was happiness because of you,1
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls,1
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool,1
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it,1
"Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh",1
"Yeah, that's my man",1
But you're right here,1
Break my soul in two looking for you,1
Ah-ah,1
Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah),1
I parked my car right between the Methodist,1
And the school that used to be ours,1
The holidays linger like bad perfume,1
November flush and your flannel cure,1
"You can run, but only so far",1
"Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in",1
As if you were a mythical thing,1
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring,1
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win,1
"Both of these things, I believe",1
"I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave",1
You booked the night train for a reason,1
So you could sit there in this hurt,1
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers,1
You're not sure which is worse,1
Then who am I related to?,1
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night,1
"Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife",1
And if it was an open-shut case,1
I never would've known from that look on your face,1
"I sit and listen, I polish plates until they gleam and glisten",1
I take your indiscretions all in good fun,1
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome,1
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head,1
I see it for what it is,1
And you know you hurt him too,1
Lost in your current like a priceless wine,1
If I can't relate to you anymore,1
Left you out there standing,1
Because I dropped your hand while dancing,1
"Ooh, you're a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines",1
"Ooh, from you, I'd buy anything",1
"When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes",1
It always leads to you and my hometown,1
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends,1
Now this is an open-shut case,1
Show me the places where the others gave you scars,1
"Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark",1
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it,1
And wonder about the only soul,1
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven,1
 'Tis the damn season,1
And I'll be yours for the weekend,1
Even though I'm leaving,1
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend,1
I can't make it go away by making you a villain,1
They count me out time and time again,1
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known,1
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own,1
I guess I should've known from the look on your face,1
I sit and watch you reading with your head low,1
"And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya",1
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed,1
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well,1
"Ooh, I guess I'll never know",1
"Ooh, and you'll go on with the show",1
"You're so much older and wiser, and I",1
When a good man hurts you,1
I notice everything you do or don't do,1
No one teaches you what to do,1
"But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me",1
"Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties",1
But it's never too late to come back to my side,1
And I pulled your body into mine,1
"Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh",1
"You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)",1
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake,1
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay,1
After giving you the best I had,1
"No, not without you",1
And if this is the long haul,1
No crowd of friends applauded,1
Begin to look like a smirk?,1
But if it's all the same to you,1
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons,1
"That ain't my jewelry on our joint account""",1
"She says, ""That ain't my Merlot on his mouth",1
Pointed at my deepest hurt?,1
"Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity",1
Este's been losin' sleep,1
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine,1
Este's a friend of mine,1
It's the same to me,1
So we could call it even,1
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin',1
Who takes my spot next to you,1
Tell me what are my words worth,1
"Tell me, when did your winning smile",1
Your hometown skeptics called it,1
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet,1
"You had a speech, you're speechless",1
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea,1
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door,1
'Cause it will never be,1
What's a lifetime of achievement,1
What should be over burrowed under my skin,1
In heart-stopping waves of hurt,1
And I couldn't give a reason,1
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze,1
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with,1
Love slipped beyond your reaches,1
The question pounds my head,1
"While I was gone, I would've asked you",1
"It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass",1
But I felt it when I passed you,1
"There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me",1
I want auroras and sad prose,1
'Cause I haven't moved in years,1
Tell me what to give after that,1
With no one around to tweet it,1
You told your family for a reason,1
"Your heart was glass, I dropped it",1
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island,1
My picture in your wallet,1
Did I shatter you?,1
Did I close my fist around something delicate?,1
And I think she'll give you that,1
"No, I didn't mean that",1
"Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury",1
How'd we get here so soon?,1
While I bathe in cliffside pools,1
There'll be happiness after me,1
But there was happiness because of me,1
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness,1
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief,1
You're so much older and wiser and I,1
"While you were out building other worlds, where was I?",1
And I want you right here,1
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?,1
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground,1
"You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh)",1
"Dom P√©rignon, you brought it",1
"Believe me, I could do it",1
"Gain the weight of you, then lose it",1
Took this dagger in me and removed it,1
Break free and leave us in ruins,1
"You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I",1
Now no one's celebrating,1
Your sister splashed out on the bottle,1
Always taking up too much space or time,1
Drawing hearts in the byline,1
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life,1
"I made you my temple, my mural, my sky",1
You couldn't keep it in,1
"But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush",1
He said the way my blue eyes shined,1
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?,1
You're the only one of you (Oh),1
"Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)",1
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me),1
"Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)",1
"And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""",1
Let me keep you company,1
"Livin' in winter, I am your summer",1
'Cause one of these things is not like the others,1
I never wanna see you walk away,1
You ran after me and called my name,1
And when we had that fight out in the rain,1
"But I will never bore you, baby",1
I know you never get just what you see,1
I know I tend to make it about me,1
Like a rainbow with all of the colors,1
But one of these things is not like the others,1
And trouble's gonna follow where I go,1
I never leave well enough alone,1
I know that I went psycho on the phone,1
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want,1
"Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)",1
"Girl, there ain't no I in ""team"" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)",1
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in,1
I'm the only one of me (Oh-oh),1
"Feels like home, stay in bed",1
"Have my back, yeah, every day",1
"Call my bluff, call you ""Babe""",1
Rice on the ground looks like snow,1
"Church bells ring, carry me home",1
To touch my hand,1
Something gave you the nerve,1
"You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too",1
"20 questions, we tell the truth",1
"Sun sinks down, no curfew",1
"Light pink sky, up on the roof",1
Sleeping in tents,1
"Video games, you pass me a note",1
"""Wanna hang out?"" Yeah, sounds like fun",1
"Lost my gloves, you give me one",1
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow,1
"School bell rings, walk me home",1
"You can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""",1
"(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)",1
I know I never think before I jump,1
"I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh",1
Even when I break your heart,1
Tell me that I'm all you want,1
You need to calm down (You need to calm down),1
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh",1
We all know now we all got crowns,1
But we figured you out,1
Comparing all the girls who are killing it,1
And we see you over there on the internet,1
"You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?",1
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay,1
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate,1
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace,1
Makin' that sign must've taken all night,1
But you would rather be in the dark ages,1
Sunshine on the street at the parade,1
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD),1
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile,1
You are somebody that we don't know,1
"You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?",1
And snakes and stones never broke my bones,1
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun,1
You're being too loud (You're being too loud),1
You need to just stop (Can you stop?),1
Like can you just not step on our gowns?,1
"Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh",1
Tell me that it's not my fault,1
Even when I lose my mind,1
Tell me that we'll be just fine,1
Tell me that you're still mine,1
I'm sorry that I hurt you,1
"It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say",1
"Went off like sirens, just crying",1
"I lived like an island, punished you with silence",1
This ultraviolet morning light below,1
"I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue",1
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go,1
It's so excruciating to see you low,1
"It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say",1
"Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us",1
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves,1
"Thought I had reason to attack, but no",1
"I pinned your hands behind your back, oh",1
Put you in jail for something you didn't do,1
The whole weekend,1
Everyone looked worse in the light,1
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs,1
Dancin' in your Levi's,1
"Sequin smile, black lipstick",1
High heels on cobblestones,1
"Vintage tee, brand new phone",1
For digging up the grave another time,1
If it could've been me,1
And it would've been sweet,1
Ros√© flowing with your chosen family,1
"We were something, don't you think so?",1
Would everything be different today?,1
If one thing had been different,1
"I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you",1
And it's another day waking up alone,1
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now,1
But we were making it count,1
"We never painted by the numbers, baby",1
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home,1
Having adventures on your own,1
I have this dream you're doing cool shit,1
And it's alright now,1
Sensual politics,1
"Drunk under a streetlight, I",1
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven,1
Hand under my sweatshirt,1
"And when you are young, they assume you know nothing",1
"Running like water, I",1
Leavin' like a father,1
"Peter losing Wendy, I",1
Tried to change the ending,1
"Marked me like a bloodstain, I",1
Steppin' on the last train,1
'Cause I knew you,1
But now I'm bleedin',1
You drew stars around my scars,1
Was all we needed,1
To kiss in cars and downtown bars,1
"Once in twenty lifetimes, I",1
Your heartbeat on the High Line,1
"Giving me your weekends, I",1
Playing hide-and-seek and,1
"Chase two girls, lose the one",1
A friend to all is a friend to none,1
"Baby, kiss it better, I",1
"And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow",1
"And if you wanted me, you really should've showed",1
You know the greatest films of all time were never made,1
I hit the Sunday matin√©e,1
But it's golden,1
I once believed love would be (Burning red),1
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed),1
And I can still see it all (In my head),1
But it's golden (Golden),1
I once believed love would be (Black and white),1
"All of you, all of me (Intertwined)",1
And I can still see it all (In my mind),1
"And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)",1
"It's brighter now, now",1
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now,1
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town,1
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down,1
"Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke",1
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked,1
And so I became the butt of the joke,1
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky,1
"And now I see daylight, I only see daylight",1
"I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye",1
"Like daylight, like daylight",1
"Like daylight, daylight",1
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you,1
Not the things I hate,1
I hit the ground running each night,1
"I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though",1
"Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""",1
"I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit",1
You are what you love,1
"I, I just think that",1
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night,1
"Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of",1
I wanna be defined by the things that I love,1
"And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)",1
"Just let it go, let it go",1
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go,1
It's golden like daylight,1
Like daylight,1
(I once believed love would be burning red),1
"(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)",1
(And I can still see it all),1
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)",1
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression,1
"And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""",1
"But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out",1
"But then you called, showed your hand",1
"I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street",1
I thought you were leading me on,1
"Back when we were card sharks, playing games",1
Memorize the creaks in the floor,1
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street,1
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours,1
"Windows flung right open, autumn air",1
"And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends",1
Leading us home,1
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head,1
Filling in the blanks as we go,1
We were a fresh page on the desk,1
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar,1
We were in the backseat,1
You're the one I want,1
"Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want",1
"Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want",1
Uh huh,1
Ah,1
Before you even knew I was gone,1
I turned around before I hit the tunnel,1
"Say it in the street, that's a knock-out",1
"Sat on the roof, you and I",1
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts,1
"But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?",1
"You said it was a great love, one for the ages",1
Is this small town,1
"I see you everywhere, the only thing we share",1
And what once was ours is no one's now,1
"I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home",1
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts,1
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah),1
I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends),1
"Oh, never again",1
I hope I never lose you,1
"That became my religion, listen",1
Sacred new beginnings,1
Barefoot in the kitchen,1
"Years ago, we were just inside",1
Walk me back to that apartment,1
You hold my hand on the street,1
"I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends",1
"Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)",1
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh),1
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh),1
"We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so",1
That someday we're gonna (Win),1
"'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know",1
"And now the storm is coming, but",1
No cameras catch my muffled cries,1
"Darling, I'm scared (Ah)",1
"Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?",1
"I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed",1
American stories burning before me,1
Who seems to care,1
"Leave with my head hung, you are the only one",1
I see the high fives between the bad guys,1
"My team is losing, battered and bruising",1
"It's been a long time coming, but",1
No cameras catch my pageant smile,1
And ran for my life (Ah),1
"Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard",1
"Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress",1
American glory faded before me,1
I'm lost in the lights,1
"Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)",1
"It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)",1
"We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)",1
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh),1
"Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws",1
To the color that we painted your brother's wall,1
Which takes me back,1
I'm with you even if it makes me blue,1
"When you jumped in first, I went in too",1
"In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool",1
"Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)",1
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh),1
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe,1
"That someday we're gonna (Win), just thought you should know",1
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three,1
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street,1
The wine is cold,1
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed,1
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet,1
Like your friends were the night that we first met,1
The moon is high,1
"""She's a bad, bad girl""",1
"My heart, my hips, my body, my love",1
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug,1
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club,1
"Oh whoa, ah",1
Crazy to think that this could work,1
We were crazy to think,1
You'll get better,1
'Cause I have to,1
"It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because",1
"This won't go back to normal, if it ever was",1
If there's no you?,1
What am I supposed to do,1
But who am I supposed to talk to?,1
And I hate to make this all about me,1
"I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try",1
"I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky",1
I just pretend it isn't real,1
"You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal",1
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror,1
"Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too",1
"Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you",1
That was the first time we were there,1
"In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared",1
Remember how I said I'd die for you?,1
We were stupid to jump,1
In the ocean separating us,1
Got the wine for you,1
"And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM",1
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patr√≥n,1
You are somebody that I don't know,1
"We'd still worship this love, ah",1
"You still do it for me, babe",1
You're the West Village,1
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you,1
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this,1
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness,1
Remember how I'd fly to you?,1
But we can patch it up good,1
Hell is when I fight with you,1
"I go there when you touch me, honey",1
I know heaven's a thing,1
"I still do it for you, babe",1
I'm New York City,1
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town,1
And I can't talk to you when you're like this,1
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair,1
"I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you",1
"Our songs, our films, united we stand",1
Just wanna be with you (Ooh),1
"But something happened, I heard him laughing",1
"And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey",1
"I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal",1
"Oh, I'd...",1
"Uh, you know, just 'round London",1
"We can go driving in, on my scooter",1
I take the long way home,1
"But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no",1
"My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)",1
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch),1
"No, it's not",1
'Cause you're not my baby,1
"But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts",1
"Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough",1
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up,1
"My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust",1
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans,1
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand,1
"Our country, guess it was a lawless land",1
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent,1
But that's not where mine lives,1
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon,1
Wanna be with you (Oh),1
"Oh whoa, oh, I",1
"I, I, I fancy you",1
"Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)",1
You know I love a London boy (Oh),1
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah),1
"Darling, I fancy you (You)",1
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah),1
"You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho",1
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you),1
"Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)",1
"Boy, I fancy you",1
Shoreditch in the afternoon,1
"You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton",1
"But God, I love the English",1
"Babes, don't threaten me with a good time",1
"Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride",1
"You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends",1
"And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End",1
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss,1
The smell of smoke would hang around this long,1
You have beaten my heart,1
"Baby, with me",1
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies,1
"Time, wondrous time",1
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven,1
When I showed you around Centennial Park,1
Gold was the color of the leaves,1
Now I send their babies presents,1
For the boys who broke my heart,1
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind,1
Tied me to you,1
One single thread of gold,1
Wool to brave the seasons,1
Chains around my demons,1
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire,1
"Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar",1
A string that pulled me,1
"Cutting me open, then healing me fine",1
"Time, mystical time",1
She said I looked like an American singer,1
Getting lunch down by the Lakes,1
And it's cool,1
Me,1
"She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but",1
What did you think I'd say to that?,1
The master of spin has a couple side flings,1
Over people like me,1
"Watching you climb, watching you climb",1
'Cause you took everything from me,1
"I'm taking my time, taking my time",1
Has really brought you two together,1
It's obvious that wanting me dead,1
Doing your dirtiest work for you,1
And women like hunting witches too,1
"They say ""move on,"" but you know I won't",1
My cannons all firin' at your yacht,1
Now I breathe flames each time I talk,1
"Or does she mouth, ""Fuck you forever""?",1
Does she smile?,1
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?,1
What do you sing on your drive home?,1
You know I will,1
"They strike to kill, and you know I will",1
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?,1
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip,1
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner,1
On your first trip to LA,1
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab,1
Like you don't even exist,1
So you leave no trace behind,1
That you picked out just for him,1
Leave the perfume on the shelf,1
But it dies and it dies and it dies,1
It's born from just one single glance,1
And clandestine meetings and longing stares,1
Ends with meetings in parking lots,1
What started in beautiful rooms,1
Tell yourself you can always stop,1
Take the road less traveled by,1
You'll be flushed when you return,1
Tell your friends you're out for a run,1
"Hood over your head, keep your eyes down",1
Make sure nobody sees you leave,1
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say),1
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying,1
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town,1
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you,1
Take the words for what they are,1
"A dwindling, mercurial high",1
A drug that only worked,1
"For you, I would ruin myself",1
"Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs",1
"Time, curious time",1
You used to work at to make a little money,1
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop,1
Teal was the color of your shirt,1
I used to think I would meet somebody there,1
Where I used to read at Centennial Park,1
Green was the color of the grass,1
And you know damn well,1
The first few hundred times,1
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else,1
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me,1
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else,1
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me,1
And you wanna scream,1
But they lie and they lie and they lie,1
They show their truth one single time,1
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares,1
Good wives always know,1
"Keep your helmet, keep your life, son",1
'Cause I knew everything when I was young,1
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me,1
"But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west",1
Is it enough?,1
"Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother",1
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other,1
"Give you my wild, give you a child",1
Sit with you in the trenches,1
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences,1
"I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor",1
You paint dreamscapes on the wall,1
Your integrity makes me seem small,1
"No, I could never give you peace",1
'Cause it lives in me,1
"And it's just around the corner, darlin'",1
As long as danger is near,1
I never had the courage of my convictions,1
"Suddenly this summer, it's clear",1
Our coming-of-age has come and gone,1
You know I miss you,1
Stopped at a streetlight,1
"I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best",1
My smoking gun,1
"Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle",1
My eclipsed sun,1
My broken drum,1
My kingdom come undone,1
As when they pulled me apart,1
"Darling, this was just as hard",1
"(Ah, ah, ah)",1
But what you did was just as dark,1
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?,1
You knew the password so I let you in the door,1
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?,1
You know I left a part of me back in New York,1
I am ash from your fire,1
My barren land,1
Your sleight of hand,1
My best laid plan,1
This has frozen my ground,1
My winless fight,1
My sleepless night,1
My twisted knife,1
This has broken me down,1
Kissin' in my car again,1
Standing in your cardigan,1
Will it patch your broken wings?,1
"If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?",1
From the far side of the gym,1
Your favorite song was playing,1
"Betty, I know where it all went wrong",1
It's like I couldn't breathe,1
When I passed your house,1
"Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard",1
I think it's 'cause of me,1
"About why you switched your homeroom, but",1
"Betty, I won't make assumptions",1
"Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)",1
"With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)",1
"With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)",1
"""Doc, I think she's crashing out""",1
Holds your hand through plastic now,1
"Someone's daughter, someone's mother",1
Something med school did not cover,1
"With you I serve, with you I fall down, down",1
"""Sir, I think he's bleeding out""",1
Crawling up the beaches now,1
I was nowhere to be found,1
"I hate the crowds, you know that",1
"Plus, I saw you dance with him",1
"Betty, right now is the last time",1
In front of all your stupid friends?,1
Will you kiss me on the porch,1
Will you have me? Will you love me?,1
So I showed up at your party,1
Is make it up to you,1
The only thing I wanna do,1
You see my face again,1
I can dream about what happens when,1
But it's finally sinkin' in,1
I was walking home on broken cobblestones,1
And I planned it out for weeks now,1
"Betty, I'm here on your doorstep",1
I dreamt of you all summer long,1
"Slept next to her, but",1
Those days turned into nights,1
"She said ""James, get in, let's drive""",1
A figment of my worst intentions,1
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like,1
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound,1
But I didn't pour the whiskey,1
Pouring out my heart to a stranger,1
"We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room",1
You never gave a warning sign,1
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign),1
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around),1
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind,1
You never gave a warning sign (All this time),1
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out),1
So I'm leavin' out the side door,1
You didn't even see the signs,1
"So many signs, so many signs",1
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out),1
So I'm leaving out the side door,1
"You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out",1
So who am I offending now?,1
I'm not your problem anymore,1
Those eyes add insult to injury,1
Balancin' on breaking branches,1
"Second, third, and hundredth chances",1
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me,1
Like he's just your understudy,1
"Ah, ah",1
"And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too",1
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here,1
"Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe",1
"You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same",1
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves,1
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies),1
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky),1
But you would still miss me in your bones,1
"And you can aim for my heart, go for blood",1
"Anywhere I want, just not home",1
And I can go anywhere I want,1
"'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave",1
As you bury me,1
You wear the same jewels that I gave you,1
But what a ghostly scene,1
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you,1
"Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring",1
"We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean",1
"And you're the hero flying around, saving face",1
'Til my dying day,1
"'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you",1
All the hell you gave me?,1
"I can see you starin', honey",1
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall,1
To pack us up and leave me with it,1
And it took you five whole minutes,1
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen,1
It must have been her fault his heart gave out,1
The doctor had told him to settle down,1
"Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud",1
"They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""",1
There's only so far new money goes,1
"The wedding was charming, if a little gauche",1
"And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorc√©e do it?""",1
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money,1
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis,1
"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny",1
And you'd come back,1
And you'd come back to me,1
You'd come back to me,1
And I knew you'd come back to me,1
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light,1
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired,1
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line,1
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time,1
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever,1
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city,1
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names,1
And then it was bought by me,1
"Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all",1
With his arms around your body,1
"I can see you standing, honey",1
I had a marvelous time,1
A marvelous time,1
A marvelous time ruining everything,1
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen,1
"Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been",1
"Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits",1
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet,1
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach,1
Fifty years is a long time,1
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green,1
And in a feud with her neighbor,1
"Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea",1
They say she was seen on occasion,1
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen,1
And losing on card game bets with Dal√≠,1
You turned into your worst fears,1
"And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain",1
Crossing out the good years,1
"Cross my heart, won't tell no other",1
"You weren't mine to lose, no",1
'Cause you weren't mine to lose,1
"So much for summer love and saying ""us""",1
"And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""",1
Cancel plans just in case you'd call,1
To live for the hope of it all,1
"For me, it was enough",1
Wanting was enough,1
Back when we were still changin' for the better,1
I remember thinkin' I had you,1
Will you call when you're back at school?,1
Wishin' I could write my name on it,1
Your back beneath the sun,1
"""Never have I ever before""",1
"Whispers of ""Are you sure?""",1
I never needed anything more,1
"Salt air, and the rust on your door",1
Our love lasts so long,1
We'll move to India forever,1
Never mine,1
But do you remember?,1
"Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all",1
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back,1
"I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere",1
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad,1
So I got wasted like all my potential,1
They told me all of my cages were mental,1
But I'm here in your doorway,1
And maybe I don't quite know what to say,1
Could've followed my fears all the way down,1
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout,1
"I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting",1
"""Meet me behind the mall""",1
I've been having a hard time adjusting,1
"(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)",1
"For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all",1
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all),1
"(""Meet me behind the mall"")",1
"(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)",1
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?),1
"(Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car"")",1
Pack your dolls and a sweater,1
"I, I",1
"And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed",1
Any time I wanted,1
Please picture me in the trees,1
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight,1
"The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams",1
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me,1
I'm still on that trapeze,1
"I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try",1
"And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why",1
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me,1
I'm still on that tightrope,1
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns,1
"And they called off the circus, burned the disco down",1
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten,1
The masquerade revelers,1
You are not like the regulars,1
I can change everything about me to fit in,1
"And when I break, it's in a million pieces",1
Shimmering beautiful,1
I'll get you out on the floor,1
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight,1
I hit my peak at seven,1
Feet in the swing over the creek,1
I was too scared to jump in,1
And I think you should come live with me,1
I used to scream ferociously,1
Before I learned civility,1
Please picture me in the weeds,1
Our love will be passed on,1
And just like a folk song,1
Or hide in the closet,1
Then you won't have to cry,1
And we can be pirates,1
Your dad is always mad and that must be why,1
"But I, I was high in the sky",1
I think your house is haunted,1
And I've been meaning to tell you,1
The love lasts so long,1
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn,1
Your braids like a pattern,1
"Cross your heart, won't tell no other",1
Are there still beautiful things?,1
With Pennsylvania under me,1
Because I'm a mirrorball,1
I've never seen someone lit from within,1
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring,1
"I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside",1
"And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, ""Good riddance""",1
"In fifty years, will all this be declassified?",1
Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?,1
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?,1
Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?,1
In any measure of a man,1
You didn't measure up,1
You'd treat her like an also-ran,1
'Cause once your queen had come,1
Then sank in stoned oblivion,1
"In public, showed me off",1
Stabbed me with your push pins,1
You hung me on your wall,1
Now you know what it feels like,1
They just ghosted you,1
From a friend of friends of mine,1
You tried to buy some pills,1
Who the fuck was that guy?,1
In your Jehovah's Witness suit,1
Gazing at me starry-eyed,1
Was any of it true?,1
"Ah, try and come for my job",1
And nobody even knows,1
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden,1
"And you deserve prison, but you won't get time",1
"You know you're good, haha, good",1
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars,1
You look like Clara Bow,1
Touch down,1
Where's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me,1
There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league,1
"Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said",1
Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads,1
But I'm making a comeback to where I belong,1
Is forgiven under my rule,1
That child's play back in school,1
"Hey, you, what if I told you we're cool?",1
But I'm coming back so strong,1
I circled you on a map,1
Worst sleep that I ever had,1
The hospital was a drag,1
What if I told you I'm back?,1
The smallest man who ever lived,1
"And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive",1
But you are what you did,1
And in plain sight you hid,1
"You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing",1
But you were gone by the morning,1
You said normal girls were boring,1
You crashed my party and your rental car,1
'Cause I'm miserable (Haha),1
"I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me) like the plague (He avoids me like the plague)",1
When they dragged you from your bed,1
Should I let it stay buried?,1
It was momentary,1
It was legendary,1
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?,1
That I can't get out of bed,1
Are they second-hand embarrassed,1
Dancing phantoms on the terrace,1
How we almost had it all,1
I wish I could unrecall,1
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles,1
You shit-talked me under the table,1
"Mr. Steal your girl, then make her cry",1
All those plot twists and dynamite,1
You cinephile in black and white,1
What we thought was for all time was momentary,1
I've felt a hole like this never before and ever since,1
A calm man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme,1
"And all at once, the ink bleeds",1
"Well, you took me to hell too",1
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes,1
And told me I reformed you?,1
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate,1
About a million times,1
"You holy ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life",1
It was unnecessary,1
"Oh, what a valiant roar",1
But that time was quite short,1
What a bland goodbye,1
He said he'd love me for all time,1
In stilettos for miles,1
I'm sure I can pass this test,1
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing,1
I keep finding his things in drawers,1
I've been doin' it since he left,1
I can hold my breath,1
"I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague",1
But that life was too short,1
He said he'd love me all his life,1
Even when you wanna die,1
I can show you lies,1
"The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night""",1
There in her glittering prime,1
"""She's having the time of her life",1
I can read your mind,1
You're the loss of my life,1
And I'll still see it until I die,1
Your arsons match your somber eyes,1
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire,1
"I'll never leave, never mind",1
I'm combing through the braids of lies,1
The coward claimed he was a lion,1
"In this light, remarkable",1
"All your life, did you know",1
You'd be picked like a rose?,1
"Rebuild all the pieces, but still wanna play the game (Oh)",1
"Even if it's handcuffed, I'm leavin' here with you",1
"Say you got somebody else, say, ""I got someone too""",1
"Push the reset button, we're becomin' something new",1
"I can feel it comin', honey, in the way you move",1
"Pull you into the closet, I haven't decided yet",1
Whether I'm gonna flip you off or,1
Or I might just love you 'til the end (Ah),1
Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party,1
I can take the upper hand and touch your body,1
Then ran and hid,1
I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch,1
"Small talk, big walk, act like I don't care what you did",1
"Once you fix your face, I'm goin' in (Yeah)",1
"Standin' at the bar like something's funny, bubbly",1
"I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean",1
"Did your research, you knew the price goin' in",1
"Lilac short skirt, the one that fits me like skin",1
'Cause old habits die screaming,1
I still can't believe it,1
"With tail between your legs, you're leavin'",1
That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming,1
"When someone plays ""The Starting Line""",1
And then I hope it's shitty in The Black Dog,1
"Bygones will be bygone, eras fadin' into grey (Fading into grey)",1
"Told my friends I hate you, but I love you just the same",1
But I think I might die if it happened,1
"Pick your poison, babe, I'm poison either way (Ha)",1
You couldn't conceive it,1
Jackals raised their hackles,1
And they believed it,1
Wise men once read fake news,1
And that none of it matters,1
I'll tell you how I've been there too,1
And you're persona non grata,1
And when that sky rains fire on you,1
You're in terrible danger,1
She's the death you chose,1
Raise worse hell than a stranger,1
Devils that you know,1
And they tried to warn you about me,1
But I'd visit in your dreams,1
Locked me up in towers,1
"""One less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen""",1
"""One bad seed kills the garden""",1
They tried to warn him about her,1
Shooting the messengers,1
"Cautions issued, he stood",1
A rose by any other name is a scandal,1
"""Wild winds are death to the candle""",1
I'm gonna get you back,1
And I hope you hear it,1
Even if I die screaming,1
And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons,1
And set fire to all my clothes,1
I am someone who until recent events,1
"The future's bright, dazzling",1
"You've got edge, she never did",1
"In this light, we're lovin' it",1
You look like Taylor Swift,1
"Them's the breaks, they don't come gently",1
It's hell on earth to be heavenly,1
Do they let you know?,1
Only when your girlish glowed flicks as just sold,1
Demanding more,1
Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours,1
You're the new God we're worshipping,1
Flesh and blood amongst war machines,1
"The crown is stained, but you're the real queen",1
They all wanna say,1
No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in LA,1
"But I think I might die if I made it, die if I made it",1
"Half moonshine, a full eclipse",1
Crowd goes wild at her fingertips,1
"In '75, the hair and lips",1
You look like Stevie Nicks,1
No one in my small town thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan,1
Die if it happened to me,1
You shared your secrets with,1
"And your location, you forgot to turn it off",1
And so I watch as you walk,1
Until I believed it too,1
Now I wanna sell my house,1
With some esoteric joke?,1
Were you makin' fun of me?,1
I still miss the smoke,1
Six weeks of breathin' clean air,1
I pledged and I still mean it,1
Was it hazing for a cruel fraternity?,1
"Was shakin', do you hate me?",1
In the shower and remember how my rain-soaked body,1
And it kills me,1
Then proceeded to play him,1
Into some bar called The Black Dog,1
You said I needed a brave man,1
And all of those best laid plans,1
And I may never open up the way I did for you,1
My longing state unspoken,1
I move through the world with a heart broken,1
That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming,1
"In The Black Dog, when someone plays ""The Starting Line""",1
And it hits me,1
You forgot to turn it off,1
And pierce new holes in my heart,1
"You low-down boy, you stand-off guy",1
And you suit and tie in the nick of time,1
You and I go from one kiss to getting married,1
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin',1
And now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned,1
Just screeching tires of true love,1
Lord knows the words we never heard,1
Protested too much,1
"""Stay away from her,"" the saboteurs",1
Down at the city hall,1
Soon enough the elders had convened,1
Bedroom eyes like a remedy,1
"He was chaos, he was revelry",1
Not growin' up at all,1
Growin' up precocious sometimes means,1
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid,1
"Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid",1
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned,1
The one thing I wanted,1
They slammed the door on my whole world,1
To rise above it,1
Too high a horse for a simple girl,1
'Cause they hate you,1
I just learned these people try and save you,1
"Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, what a mess",1
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best,1
To cage you,1
I'd rather burn my whole life down,1
I'll tell you somethin' 'bout my good name,1
"Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter",1
It's mine alone to disgrace,1
"Another summer, takin' cover, rolling thunder",1
"But oh my God, you should see your faces",1
"I'm having his baby""",1
"I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want",1
"And no, you can't come to the weddin'",1
"Time, doesn't it give some perspective?",1
"And oh my God, you should see your faces",1
I'm his lady,1
Even my daddy just loves him,1
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and,1
"All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over",1
Went to my parents and they came around,1
We came back when the heat died down,1
"Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer",1
I bestow upon my fakest smiles,1
There's a lot of people in town that,1
And counteract the chemistry and undo the destiny,1
Of my heart when he touches me,1
Thinkin' it can change the beat,1
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see,1
Who say they want what's best for me,1
God save the most judgmental creeps,1
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing,1
I just learned these people only raise you,1
I forget if this was ever fun,1
I forget how the West was won,1
You'll (You'll) find (Find) someone,1
"For so long, London",1
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free,1
"The spirit was gone, we would never come to",1
"I stopped CPR, after all, it's no use",1
"I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath",1
I founded the club she's heard great things about,1
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out,1
You'll find someone,1
"So long, London",1
"Oh, the tragedy",1
"Thinkin', how much sad did you think I had",1
"I stopped tryin' to make him laugh, stopped tryin' to drill the safe",1
"Wet through my clothes, weary bones got the chill",1
My spine split from carrying us up the hill,1
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away,1
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift,1
"I saw, in my mind, fairy lights through the mist",1
Like I lost my twin,1
Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad),1
"I might just not get up,I might stay",1
Fuck it if I can't have him (Can't have him),1
(Ah),1
So fuck you if I can't have us,1
Stitches undone,1
"Two graves, one gun",1
I'll find someone,1
'Fore I'd have to go be free?,1
"Two (Two) graves (Graves), one gun (Gun)",1
Stitches (Stitches) undone (Undone),1
But I'm (I'm) not (Not) the (The) one (One),1
A moment (Moment) of warm sun (Sun),1
Had (Had) a (A) good (Good) run (Run),1
I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for,1
And I'm just getting color back into my face,1
You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days,1
I died on the altar waitin' for the proof,1
"You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?",1
Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?,1
And you say I abandoned the ship,1
Just how low did you,1
How much tragedy?,1
So how much sad did you think I had,1
When you're not sure if he wants to be there,1
Every breath feels like rarest air,1
Every day of a love affair,1
And my friends said it isn't right to be scared,1
Holding tight to your quiet resentment,1
My white-knuckle dyin' grip,1
But I was going down with it,1
He don't understand me,1
He was with her in dreams,1
I've felt a glow like this never before and never since,1
Like a freight train through a small town,1
So who's afraid of me?,1
I am what I am 'cause you trained me,1
You caged me and then you called me crazy,1
And you taught me,1
And you hurt me (You should be),1
'Cause you lured me (You should be),1
And that's why you're still singin' along,1
Put narcotics into all of my songs,1
That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong,1
That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn,1
"I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?",1
So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs,1
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me,1
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me,1
"Then say they didn't do it to hurt me, but what if they did?",1
"So tell me everything is not about me, but what if it is?",1
Then we could all just laugh until I cry,1
Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one more joke,1
You don't get to tell me you feel bad,1
"At all costs, keep your good name",1
The bullet had just grazed,1
The scandal was contained,1
Nothing makes me feel more alive,1
The smoke cloud billows out his mouth,1
The jokes that he told across the bar,1
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels,1
Were revolting and far too loud,1
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed,1
"I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""",1
"Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""",1
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away,1
If we know the steps anyway?,1
Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames,1
"Woah, maybe I can't",1
"I can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can)",1
But your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger,1
When I told 'em he's my man (I told 'em he's my man),1
"They shook their heads sayin', ""God, help her""",1
"No really, I can",1
"Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man",1
"I'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all mine",1
"Good boy, that's right, come close",1
He just hadn't met me yet,1
He had a halo of the highest grade,1
A perfect case for my certain skill set,1
And I could see it from a mile away,1
Softly traces hearts on my face,1
His hands so calloused from his pistol,1
On a six-lane Texas highway,1
The dopamine races through his brain,1
"If you wanted me dead, you should've just said",1
You don't get to tell me about sad,1
But my bare hands paved their paths,1
The who's who of who's that is poised for the attack,1
"They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true",1
You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too,1
Wearing imaginary rings,1
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings,1
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here,1
"And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway",1
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams,1
To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams),1
I'm runnin',1
"Now we're at the starting line, I did my time",1
Swirled you into all of my poems,1
"All those nights, he kept me goin'",1
For just one glimpse of his smile,1
Watch me daily disappearing,1
"My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it",1
I will never lose my baby again,1
"As I said in my letters, now that I know better",1
Toss the ashes off the ledge,1
"Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches",1
In the shade of how he was feeling,1
"Years of labor, locks and ceilings",1
For just one hour of sunshine,1
Handcuffed to the spell I was under,1
And my friends all smell like weed or little babies,1
And this city reeks of driving myself crazy,1
A town you're just a guest in,1
Is that a bad thing to say in a song?,1
"Go on, fuck me up",1
(Take me to) Florida,1
The town you'll get arrested (Florida),1
For a time-share down in Destin (Take me to Florida),1
A town you're just a guest in (Florida),1
So take me to Florida,1
Love loves me like this and I want to resist,1
"What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida",1
"At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida",1
The town you'll get arrested,1
"And in my mind, they sink into the swamp",1
For a time-share down in Destin,1
All of the bodies that have ever been on my body,1
So I did my best to lay to rest,1
"Well, no one asks any questions here",1
And your cheating husband disappeared,1
All my girls got their lace and their crimes,1
"Yes, I'm haunted, but I'm feeling just fine",1
"Well, me and my ghosts, we had a hell of a time",1
Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine,1
I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away,1
The hurricane with my name when it came,1
You were sleeping soundly,1
And I tried to warn you about them,1
Were you waiting at our old spot,1
Out window panes talking utter nonsense,1
Long may you reign,1
And she realized,1
It felt like freedom,1
That as she was leaving,1
You can be sure,1
But she's got the best stories,1
Out the drive one evenin',1
There's an escape in escaping,1
Hearts are hers for the breakin',1
That the chariot is waitin',1
"But, none of it is changin'",1
And she's laughing drawin' aces,1
"First, they're off to the races",1
Men of many faces,1
She's been many places with,1
She must bolt,1
And she just knows,1
Down in the floorboards,1
That's when she sees the littlest leaks,1
What a charming Saturday,1
Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats,1
"When it's all roses, portrait poses",1
"And at first blush, this is fate",1
"You're an animal, you are bloodthirsty",1
You have no idea,1
"Taming a bear, making him care",1
Strings tied to levers,1
Of the entire torrid affair,1
Now and then she rereads the manuscript,1
Higher and higher (Higher and higher),1
"Way to go, tiger (Way to go, tiger)",1
In sweetness,1
But now we'll curtail your curiosity,1
You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline,1
The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean,1
(You have no idea),1
You have no room in your dreams for regrets,1
You have a favorite spot on the swing set,1
You got the dragonflies above your bed,1
To keep it from you in sweetness,1
The secret we all vowed,1
Buried down deep and out of your reach,1
And you have no idea,1
"Covered in mud, you look ridiculous",1
You're a just ruler,1
At your dinosaurs,1
Long may you roar,1
To keep it for you in sweetness,1
All this showmanship,1
Slowed-down clocks tethered,1
Watching him jump then pulling him under,1
And she liked the way he tastes,1
So I crossed my thoughtless heart,1
We said it was just goodbye for now,1
In different galaxies,1
Underneath the same moon,1
We both did the best we could do,1
When crossing your jet stream,1
And sometimes it gets me,1
Than it was on me,1
But life was always easier on you,1
"I've heard great things, Peter",1
A natural scene stealer?,1
Are you still a mind reader?,1
"Oh, never to keep",1
I thought it was just goodbye for now,1
And I didn't wanna come down,1
My ribs get the feeling she did,1
"Peter, was she lying?",1
She said she was trying,1
Once found us beguiling,1
The goddess of timing,1
Is it something I did?,1
Preserved from when we were just kids,1
In closets like cedar,1
My lost fearless leader,1
"Forgive me, Peter",1
And I didn't wanna hang around,1
Never to keep,1
Just like any good trophy hunter,1
"And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn",1
"He was a cad, wanted her bad",1
"And they nicknamed her ""The Bolter""",1
"Behind her back, her best mates laughed",1
Then she runs like it's a race,1
Excellent fun 'til you get to know her,1
"Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless",1
With a quite bewitching face,1
By everyone except her own father,1
"A curious child, ever reviled",1
And I can confirm she made,1
When she was six in frigid water,1
"By all accounts, she almost drowned",1
Has turned out the light,1
But the woman who sits by the window,1
When you were mine,1
To hold on (Hold on) to the days (To the days),1
"Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried",1
"Lost to the ""Lost Boys"" chapter of your life",1
And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired,1
"And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five",1
'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned,1
"With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you'd learned",1
"As the men masqueraded, I hoped you'd return",1
They compared their licenses,1
"He said, ""I'm not a donor but",1
"I'd give you my heart if you needed it""",1
You might just have dealt the final blow,1
Always risin' from the ashes,1
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix,1
Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?,1
"Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time",1
Remember lookin' at this room? We loved it 'cause of the light,1
"We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't",1
"You say, ""I don't understand,"" and I say, ""I know you don't""",1
It hits different (Yeah),1
'Cause it's you,1
To take me away,1
Or have they come to take me away?,1
Is it okay? Is it you?,1
Is that your key in the door?,1
I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway,1
"Argumentative, antithetical dream girl",1
Bet I could still melt your world,1
And I felt you and I held you for a while,1
"In the good in the world, you once believed in me",1
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief,1
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy,1
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes,1
"Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough",1
You were the one that I loved,1
Mendin' all her gashes,1
"Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes",1
She rolled her eyes and said,1
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?,1
You're losin' me,1
"""To believe, unless you're choosin' me""",1
"""Choose something, babe, I got nothing"" (I got nothing)",1
"""Lose something, babe, risk something"" (You're losin' me)",1
"""Do something, babe, say something"" (Say something)",1
"And I'm fadin', thinkin'",1
Who only wanted you to see her,1
A pathological people pleaser,1
And I wouldn't marry me either,1
I'm the best thing at this party (You're losin' me),1
"Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me",1
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier,1
"I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy",1
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?,1
How long could we be a sad song,1
Stop (Stop) 'cause you're losin' me,1
"""You don't know what you got until it's gone""",1
And you know what they all say,1
"Now, you're runnin' down the hallway",1
I know my pain is such an imposition,1
And the air is thick with loss and indecision,1
"My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick",1
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick,1
Why the wound is still bleedin',1
"I trace the evidence, make it make some sense",1
Cursed the space that I needed,1
"I find the artifacts, cried over a hat",1
Was alight with the sparks,1
And the slow dance,1
Were hitting their marks,1
Then the actors,1
Might be the only way to move forward,1
Lookin' backwards,1
The Professor said to write what you know,1
Like scenes of a show,1
And the years passed,1
She wasn't sure,1
Everything had been above board,1
She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years,1
With dart boards on the backs of their doors,1
Then she dated boys who were her own age,1
And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed,1
Afterwards she only ate kids' cereal,1
And made coffee every morning in a French press,1
"In the age of him, she wished she was thirty",1
But soon it was over,1
Soon they'd be pushin' strollers,1
He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was,1
"He said, ""No, just a good samaritan""",1
"""You're a professional""",1
And the tears fell,1
In synchronicity with the score,1
And at last,1
Each bar plays our song,1
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $446,1
I stopped receiving invitations,1
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car,1
"Yeah, my sadness is contagious (My sadness is contagious)",1
And I never don't cry (And I never don't cry) at the bar,1
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings,1
Freedom felt like summ–µr then on the coast,1
Rip the band-aid off and skip town lik–µ an asshole outlaw,1
"I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost",1
Nothing has ever felt so wrong,1
"They say that if it's right, you know",1
She knew what the agony had been for,1
You just start walkin' on,1
Like waiting for a bus that never shows,1
Then threw up on the street,1
I pictured you with other girls in love,1
You made a mess of me,1
I washed my hands of us at the club,1
But the story isn't mine anymore,1
Now and then I reread the manuscript,1
One last souvenir from my trip to your shores,1
The only thing that's left is the manuscript,1
It's so quiet,1
"No one heard, not a single word was heard",1
"Ah-ah-ah, ah",1
Except all of our friends,1
D-Y-I-N-G,1
Sitting in a tree,1
My beloved ghost and me,1
Leaving me bereft and reeling,1
The deflation of our dreaming,1
Silenced as the soul was leaving,1
How the death rattle breathing,1
Say it once again with feeling,1
One gasp and then,1
They called it all off,1
Didn't you hear?,1
Walking in circles like she was lost,1
Guess who we ran into at the shops?,1
"Then feverishly calling their cousins (Oh, oh)",1
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him,1
Soon they'll go home to their husbands,1
"Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?",1
And fell victim to interlopers glances,1
"We learn the right steps to different dances (Oh, oh-oh)",1
We were blind to unforeseen circumstances,1
We must know,1
'Cept all of our friends,1
It's happ'nin' again,1
I can't pretend like I understand,1
But I still don't know,1
I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists,1
I feel so high school every time I look at you,1
We would pick a decade,1
My friends used to play a game where,1
Now that I know what's what,1
"If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck",1
Now I seem to be scared to go outside,1
"You see, I was a debutante in another life, but",1
My eternal consolation prize,1
"Tell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is",1
Teach me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto,1
"'Cause I feel so high school (So high school) every time I look at you, but look at you",1
I'm hearing voices like a madman,1
To that impression you did of your dad again,1
I feel like laughing in the middle of practice,1
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto,1
"No one's ever had me (Had me), not like you",1
Then pull me to the backseat (Backseat),1
"Get my car door, isn't that sweet? (That sweet)",1
I'm bettin' on all three for us two (All three),1
"It's just a game, but really (Really)",1
"Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me (Kill me)",1
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba,1
"'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you, but look at you",1
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you,1
And so a touch that was my birth right became foreign,1
We could not cure them,1
Our maladies were such,1
He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsmen,1
"I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools",1
And I couldn't watch it happen,1
"You needed me, but you needed drugs more",1
You turned me into an idea of sorts,1
You said some things that I can't unabsorb,1
And you just watched it happen,1
Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school,1
And you saw my bones out with somebody new,1
As the decade would play us for fools,1
And I just watched it happen,1
Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus,1
Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness,1
Your hologram stumbled into my apartment,1
She's the albatross (Ah),1
So cross your thoughtless heart (Ah),1
(This terrible danger; Ah),1
And all this terrible danger (Ah),1
I'm the life you chose,1
Looks now more like an angel,1
The devil that you know,1
I swept in at the rescue,1
I'm the albatross,1
Spread my wings like a parachute,1
Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules,1
All to outrun my desertion of you,1
And you just watched it,1
"Cooler in theory, but not if you force it",1
This post-mortem,1
We hereby conduct,1
Will I always wonder?,1
Will I always,1
'Cause I wonder,1
Say you'll always wonder,1
And if you wanna tear my world apart,1
Say you loved me,1
"So if you wanna break my cold, cold heart",1
"To be, it just didn't happen",1
Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?,1
If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh,1
Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?,1
Like it never happened,1
Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon?,1
And you have some kids with an internet starlet,1
So if I sell my apartment,1
To know what to do,1
Too impaired by my youth,1
Like so many wrecks do,1
Back to the moment I crashed into you,1
Down that passage in time,1
We wished we could live in instead of this,1
And getting married off for the highest bid,1
I was onto something,1
A greater woman stays cool,1
And I sound like an infant,1
"Oh, still I dream of him",1
Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand,1
Slow is the quicksand,1
"Oh, it was sinking in (Sinking in, oh)",1
Mine play out like fools in a fable,1
Cards on the table,1
But I looked to the sky and said,1
"Oh, was it punishment?",1
I got cursed like Eve got bitten,1
And it was written,1
I attend Christmas parties from outside,1
Like I'm some deranged weirdo,1
So I look in people's windows,1
"I'm addicted to the ""if only""",1
Does it feel alright to not know me?,1
"Downtown, downtown, downtown",1
What are the chances you'd be,1
I tried searching faces on streets,1
"Now, now, now, now, now, now",1
I still ponder what it meant,1
You had stopped and tilted your head,1
They have their friends over to drink nice wine,1
Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen,1
But I howl like a wolf at the moon,1
Everyone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now,1
And I look unstable,1
"Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah",1
'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all,1
I patched up the crack along the wall,1
"The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line",1
That I was onto something,1
"They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time",1
"So, they set my life in flames, I regret to say",1
What happens if it becomes who you are?,1
"They say, ""What doesn't kill you makes you aware""",1
Twisting all my smiles into snarls,1
I was in my tower weaving nightmares,1
'Cause that's where I was when I got the call,1
Patching up the crack along the wall,1
I was in my new house placing daydreams,1
But I looked to the sky and said (Please),1
To change the prophecy?,1
Spending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay,1
"I'm just a paperweight, in shades of greige",1
No sign of soulmates,1
I'm so afraid I sealed my fate,1
But even statues crumble if they're made to wait,1
A greater woman has faith,1
Gathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table,1
Transfixed by rose golden glows,1
I'm afflicted by the not knowing so,1
A feather taken by the wind blowing,1
"South, south, south, south, south, south",1
And then she wrote headlines,1
Each time that Aimee stomped across my grave,1
"And it wasn't a fair fight, or a clean kill",1
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel,1
"But I dreamed that one day, I could say",1
"That threatens to push me down the stairs, at our school",1
And a plaque underneath it,1
There's a bronze spray-tanned statue of you,1
When I picture my hometown,1
"And way up there, I actually love it",1
"And in my fantasies, I rise above it",1
"Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me",1
This place made me feel worthless,1
I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose,1
"I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine",1
"I'm lonely, but I'm good",1
"I dreamed about it in the dark, the night I felt like I might die",1
"When they found a better planet, only the gentle survived",1
I hate it here so I will go to lunar valleys in my mind,1
It was freezing in the palace,1
"If I'd been there, I'd hate it",1
Nostalgia is a mind's trick,1
Seems like it was never even fun back then,1
"In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take",1
"But I prayed that one day, I could say",1
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real,1
"All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'",1
As you boarded your train,1
Northbound I got carried away,1
"Out, out, out, out, out, out",1
I spied the catch in your breath,1
I had died the tiniest death,1
"Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head",1
So I pushed each boulder up that hill,1
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal,1
"Screamed ""Thank you, Aimee"" to the night sky, and the stars are stunnin'",1
"And our town, it looks so small, from way up here",1
"A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause-",1
I pushed each boulder up the hill,1
"And one day, your kid comes home singin'",1
"And so I changed your name, and any real defining clues",1
I don't think you've changed much,1
"And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue",1
And maybe you've reframed it,1
"That there wouldn't be this, if there hadn't been you",1
"But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth",1
I built a legacy which you can't undo,1
I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool,1
"Your words are still just ringing in my head, ringing in my head",1
Leaving me safe and stranded?,1
How dare you think it's romantic,1
Where they can all understand it,1
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?,1
When the silence came,1
"So scarlet, it was",1
Looked up at the sky and it was,1
And I chose you,1
I see you every day now,1
"""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top ros√©, that's how""",1
"""How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?"" You say",1
Like you were my closest friend,1
Laughing with my feet in your lap,1
'Cause we lost track of time again,1
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf,1
When the morning came,1
I just wanna stay,1
The lavender haze,1
No deal (No deal),1
"I feel (I feel), the lavender haze creeping up on me",1
Get it off my desk (Get it off my desk),1
That lavender haze,1
I feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me,1
"But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)",1
"They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)",1
"I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)",1
Is a one-night or a wife,1
"We were shaking, blind and hazy",1
Sobbing with your head in your hands,1
Is if I'm gonna be your bride,1
Ain't that the way shit always ends?,1
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism,1
"Pierced through the heart, but never killed",1
"Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city",1
And I'm a monster on the hill,1
"Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby",1
'Cause you got tired of my scheming,1
(Tale as old as time),1
I end up in crisis,1
They come with prices and vices,1
I should not be left to my own devices,1
I've ghosted stand there in the room,1
"When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people",1
Midnights become my afternoons,1
"I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser",1
That's a real fucking legacy to leave,1
"That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)",1
"So scarlet, it was (Maroon)",1
Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon),1
And I lost you,1
The rubies that I gave up,1
"I feel you, no matter what",1
"Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us",1
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway,1
The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see),1
All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me),1
I'll build you a fort on some planet,1
Or trying to stay for the kids,1
Twenty years at your job,1
She's a crook who was caught,1
Not a twin from your dreams,1
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed,1
When the words of a sister come back in whispers,1
Look at each other like that,1
"Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends",1
You ask for the tab,1
When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old,1
I'm right where,1
But if you ever think you got it wrong,1
And it's been so long,1
I can't bear witness,1
If our love died young,1
Mind my business,1
'Cause I'm right where I cause no harm,1
"Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware",1
I'm sure that you got a wife out there,1
"I, I stayed there",1
Everybody moved on,1
You told me that you met someone,1
"I, I could feel the mascara run",1
"Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right",1
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours,1
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse,1
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me,1
"Fifteen years, fifteen million tears",1
"All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)",1
"You handled it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)",1
"I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)",1
My melancholia,1
And you don't really read into,1
"Oh, you don't ever say too much",1
Staring at the ceiling with you,1
Meet me at midnight,1
You just go,1
Then you go,1
So then you go,1
"You know, you know, you know, you know",1
You know in your soul,1
And you know in your soul,1
I know when it's time to go,1
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul,1
But I've got me,1
He's got my past frozen behind glass,1
Praying to his greed,1
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones,1
Then wondered why I left,1
"I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all",1
Begging 'til my knees bled,1
Like some kind of congressman?,1
(A tale as old as time),1
And life will lose all its meaning,1
Holiday peppermint candy,1
It came like a postcard,1
"He was sunshine, I was midnight rain",1
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice,1
Jumping off things in the ocean,1
"A slow-motion, love potion",1
My boy was a montage,1
"But for some, it was paradise",1
Pageant queens and big pretenders,1
"Full of cages, full of fences",1
My town was a wasteland,1
Rain,1
"Yeah, you can face this",1
You've got no reason to be afraid,1
"So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it",1
Everything you lose is a step you take,1
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned,1
And I saw something they can't take away,1
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown,1
My friends from home don't know what to say,1
"The jokes weren't funny, I took the money",1
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss,1
I hosted parties and starved my body,1
"I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this",1
Picture perfect shiny family,1
"But for him, it's every day",1
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money,1
So I peered through a window,1
"Have to say, by the way",1
Miscommunications and I,1
"Fuckin' situations, circumstances",1
But one thing after another,1
A color I've searched for since,1
Before you painted all my nights,1
'Cause I don't remember who I was,1
I swear that it was somethin',1
We had one thing goin' on,1
"Big city, wrong choices",1
"Good girl, sad boy",1
"(Midnights like this, midnights like this)",1
Except on midnights like this,1
And I never think of him,1
"Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted",1
Except for when I'm on TV,1
And he never thinks of me,1
"Just what we wanted, just what we wanted",1
All of me changed like midnight rain,1
"'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain",1
And the life I gave away,1
All the love we unravel,1
"A deep portal, time travel",1
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare,1
I called a taxi to take me there,1
I'll run away,1
I play my songs in the parking lot,1
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it,1
And to hide that would be so dishonest,1
My smile is like I won a contest,1
Blurring out my periphery,1
"Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene",1
"I searched ""aurora borealis green""",1
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen,1
And it's like snow at the beach,1
"I'm unglued, thanks to you",1
"And my flight was awful, thanks for asking",1
And time can't stop me quite like you did,1
Life is emotionally abusive,1
Passing by unbeknownst to me,1
But it might just have been you,1
I saw flecks of what could've been lights,1
"One night, a few moons ago",1
"At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)",1
"It's me, hi (Hi)",1
"Everybody agrees, everybody agrees",1
"""She's laughing up at us from hell""",1
And then someone screams out,1
The family gathers around and reads it,1
She thinks I left them in the will,1
"'Til you do, 'til it's true",1
Now it's like snow at the beach,1
"I can't speak, afraid to jinx it",1
Anyway,1
"Something different bloomed, writing in my room",1
"I picked the petals, he loves me not",1
"I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May",1
Just to learn that you never cared,1
I waited ages to see you there,1
All my days,1
There's just one who could make me stay,1
"I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out",1
I touch my phone as if it's your face,1
"I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys",1
"It's okay, we're the best of friends",1
I don't even dare to wish it,1
"I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me",1
I play it cool with the best of them,1
"Summer went away, still, the yearning stays",1
It's coming down,1
You wanting me (You wanting me),1
Flying in a dream (Flying in a dream),1
Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach),1
Can this be a real thing? Can it?,1
Now I'm all for you like Janet,1
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet,1
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want,1
And you're sitting in front of me,1
"Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it",1
"I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides",1
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep,1
Misery,1
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me,1
Fatefully,1
And I'm never gonna love again,1
I've had some tricks up my sleeve,1
Forever is the sweetest con,1
With your boots beneath my bed,1
Like the Gardens of Babylon,1
Now you hang from my lips,1
But that was all before I locked it down,1
When you passed through town,1
And the ladies lunching have their stories about,1
Really did believe I was the one,1
And the old men that I've swindled,1
Plotted hard to fuck this up,1
And the skeletons in both our closets,1
You had some tricks up your sleeve,1
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar,1
Now I'm waiting by the phone,1
Just a fancy car,1
Never wanted love,1
I've got some tricks up my sleeve,1
And you passed right by,1
The knife cuts both ways,1
Never be so kind,1
"If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break",1
(And now) I'm all about you,1
Climbed right back up the cliff,1
"If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go",1
And he feels like home,1
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky,1
And he's passing by,1
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing,1
Your nemeses,1
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things,1
Past me,1
Ever and evermore,1
And my waves meet your shore,1
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more),1
No more tug of war,1
'Cause I fell from the pedestal,1
"But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready",1
And we live in peace,1
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door,1
When I dropped my sword,1
At the golden gates they once held the keys to,1
Missing me,1
I always felt I must look better in the rear view,1
Actually,1
Now I know,1
This is gonna be one of those things,1
"Oh, I thought",1
"But I said, ""Dancin' is a dangerous game""",1
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be,1
I wish to know,1
Grieving for the living,1
"But I don't, I just sit here and wait",1
And the old widow goes to the stone every day,1
Tarnished but so grand,1
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow,1
In from the snow,1
In a faith-forgotten land,1
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones,1
Making you my centerfold,1
"Sorry for not making you my, making you my",1
But I think that I forgot to say your name,1
I'm on a bench in Coney Island,1
"But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name",1
And when I got into the accident,1
A universe away,1
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?,1
"With a big cake, happy birthday",1
Were you standing in the hallway,1
Did I leave you hanging every single day?,1
By the gold clock,1
In the tree line,1
Magnificently cursed,1
He's in the room,1
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see,1
And I'm covered in you,1
And you asked me to dance,1
With some tent-like thing,1
And the tennis court was covered up,1
In you,1
Now I'm covered in you,1
"In you, in you",1
It's the goddamn fight of my life,1
"So yeah, it's a war",1
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark,1
"So yeah, it's a fire",1
And drink my husband's wine,1
He wants what's only yours,1
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become,1
So tell me to run,1
On begged and borrowed time,1
I'd live and die for moments that we stole,1
He's gonna burn this house to the ground,1
"Spring breaks loose, but so does fear",1
"Crescent moon, coast is clear",1
What would he do if he found us out?,1
"Spring breaks loose, the time is near",1
Clover blooms in the fields,1
"(And now) Yeah, yeah",1
You forget to be clever,1
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?,1
"(Out on waves, being tossed)",1
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days),1
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost),1
"I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)",1
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?),1
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now),1
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost),1
Is there a line that I could just go cross?,1
"I'm on waves, out being tossed",1
Or the violence of the dog days,1
Whether weather be the frost,1
"To be certain, we'll be tall again",1
"Oh, can we just get a pause?",1
And the things that will be lost,1
Can't not think of all the cost,1
(Evermore),1
Barefoot in the wildest winter,1
To be double-crossed,1
Sending signals,1
On the very moment all was lost,1
"I rewind the tape, but all it does is pause",1
What I used to fight for,1
Can't remember,1
Guess I'm feeling unmoored,1
(Or the violence of the dog days),1
"(I'm on waves, out being tossed)",1
Never be so clever,1
I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?),1
How it was supposed to be,1
"Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it",1
Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?,1
"You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no",1
"You left me no, you left me no",1
Right where you left me,1
"Some perspective, but I sat and stared",1
They expected me to find somewhere,1
"Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there",1
Right when I felt the moment stop,1
"I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop",1
"But I, I'm right where you left me",1
Wages earned and lessons learned,1
Pages turn and stick to each other,1
Matches burn after the other,1
But I'm right where you left me,1
"Trends change, rumors fly through new skies",1
"Strangers get born, strangers get buried",1
"Friends break up, friends get married",1
This pain wouldn't be for evermore,1
This pain wouldn't be for,1
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step,1
You were there,1
Hey December,1
Staring out an open window,1
Addressed to the fire,1
Writing letters,1
But I still feel you all around,1
I'd think you were singing to me now,1
And how you left them all to me,1
All your closets of backlogged dreams,1
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie,1
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me,1
Should've kept every grocery store receipt,1
Asked you to write it down for me,1
I should've asked you how to be,1
I should've asked you questions,1
The car ride back and up the stairs,1
And I complained the whole way there,1
You'd always go past where our feet could touch,1
Long limbs and frozen swims,1
You loved the amber skies so much,1
The autumn chill that wakes me up,1
I'd think you were listening to me now,1
You forget to be polite,1
Never wield such power,1
You forget your power,1
Never be so polite,1
I'd think you were talking to me now,1
You forget to be kind,1
But you're still around,1
It's been a long time,1
And seeing the shape of your name,1
"Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea",1
Trying to find the one where I went wrong,1
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone,1
Put me in a bad light,1
Motion capture,1
I've been down since July,1
Gray November,1
Your closure,1
"Closure, closure, your closure",1
But it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary,1
That you put between you and me,1
Staying friends would iron it out so nice,1
Still spells out pain,1
I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life,1
"Your closure, your closure",1
I can feel you smoothing me over,1
"And my tears, and my beers and my candles",1
I'm fine with my spite,1
Some situation that needs to be handled,1
Don't treat me like,1
Looks like you know that now,1
The way it all went down,1
It wasn't right,1
I just may like some explanations,1
"Half-moon eyes, bad surprise",1
Did you realize out of time?,1
That means you did it right,1
Desert all your past lives,1
"Dear reader, burn all the files",1
Pick somewhere and just run,1
"Dear reader, get out your map",1
You're already in one,1
"Dear reader, if it feels like a trap",1
"Oh God, rest my soul",1
"Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first",1
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts,1
"Years of tearing down our banners, you and I",1
"If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?",1
If I'd only played it safe,1
You're a crisis of my faith,1
"But lord you made me feel important, and then you tried to erase us",1
"And if you never saved me from boredom, I could've gone on as I was",1
"If I never blushed, then they could've never whispered about this",1
"If you never touched me, I would've gone along with the righteous",1
If you never looked my way,1
All I used to do was pray,1
And if I was a child did it matter if you got to wash your hands?,1
"And if I was some paint, did it splatter on a promising grown man?",1
If you tasted poison you could've spit me out at the first chance,1
If you would've blinked then I would've looked away at the first glance,1
And if you don't recognize yourself,1
"Dear reader, bend when you can",1
"All of this to say, I hope you're okay",1
Snap when you have to,1
I was a functioning alcoholic,1
But they forgot to come and get me,1
I was supposed to be sent away,1
You should find another,1
"Find another, you should find another",1
"You should find another, you should find another (Guiding light)",1
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire,1
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care,1
"To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there",1
If you knew where I was walking,1
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking,1
"But darling, darling, please",1
Spilling out to you for free,1
These desperate prayers of a cursed man,1
My fourth drink in my hand,1
I prefer hiding in plain sight,1
So I wander through these nights,1
Make sure you don't miss,1
"Dear reader, when you aim at the devil",1
"Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets",1
(You should find another),1
Just 'cause they asked you,1
"Dear reader, you don't have to answer",1
It must be counterfeit (It must be counterfeit),1
"And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry, blood moon lit (Blood moon lit)",1
"Glitch, ah-yeah",1
"And that's romance, let's dance",1
Dragged my feet right down the aisle,1
Bad omen,1
"Storm coming, good husband",1
"My love, we were in Paris",1
'Cause we were in Paris,1
"In an alleyway, drinking champagne",1
We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling,1
In my mind,1
Be the tower at midnight,1
Let the only flashing lights,1
In swooping sloping cursive letters,1
Confess my truth,1
To somewhere the culture's clever,1
I wanna transport you,1
Into loving me forever,1
I wanna brainwash you,1
"I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown",1
And not the kind that's thrown,1
Sip wine by my side in the shade,1
"Levitated thought, all the messes made",1
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours,1
And on my page and on the whole world,1
Privacy sign on the door,1
"At the house lonely, good money",1
I'd pay if you'd just know me,1
Seemed like the right thing at the time,1
Depending on what kind of mood and situationship I'm in,1
I thought we had no chance,1
I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing,1
"A brief interruption, a slight malfunction",1
(The system's breaking down),1
The system's breaking down,1
(Our love is blacking out),1
But it's been two-thousand one-hundred and ninety days of our love blackout,1
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground,1
I was supposed to sweat you out,1
And what's in my system,1
You don't live in my part of town but maybe I'll see you out some weekend,1
You know there's many different ways,1
We were supposed to be just friends,1
"But oh, you were keeping count",1
"And it's never enough, it's never enough",1
"Yeah, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love",1
"Ooh, ooh, ohh",1
Woo,1
Put on your records and regret meeting me,1
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love,1
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?,1
That you can kill the one you love,1
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic,1
But you're the reason,1
"No, I didn't, but thanks, though",1
Left all these broken parts (Oh-oh),1
"'Cause he took me out of my box (Oh-oh, oh-oh)",1
Than with all the Kens,1
I felt more when we played pretend,1
He was my best friend down at the sandlot,1
"Just say when, I'd play again",1
"My boy (My boy) only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh-oh-oh",1
"He saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh",1
"'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch",1
"I'm queen (I'm queen) of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh",1
"My boy (My boy) only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh",1
'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me,1
Because he loves me (He loves me),1
And I'll tell you that he runs,1
"But first, pull the string",1
Put me back on my shelf,1
I know I'm just repeating myself,1
We could've played for keeps this time,1
There was a litany of reasons why,1
"My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh-oh-oh",1
"I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh",1
"'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night",1
"I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh",1
"My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh",1
"Stole my tortured heart (Oh-oh, oh-oh)",1
Told me I'm better off (Oh-oh),1
And no one here's to blame,1
But I'm not (Oh-oh),1
How dare you say that it's-?,1
All your indecent exposures,1
Encounters closer and closer,1
I loved your hostile take-overs,1
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad),1
Fuck it if I can't have him (Fuck it if I can't have him),1
"For a moment, I was heavenstruck",1
The existence of you,1
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about,1
That somehow seems so hollow now?,1
In a field in my same old town,1
"Just to leave me here, naked and alone",1
Did you take all my old clothes,1
"Down bad, wakin' up in blood",1
"Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym",1
"For a moment, I knew cosmic love",1
Then send me back where I came from,1
Showed me that this world is bigger than us,1
Tell me I was the chosen one,1
Just to do experiments on?,1
In a cloud of sparkling dust,1
Did you really beam me up,1
"I'm not, I'm not",1
But you should've seen him when he first got me,1
Rivulets descend my plastic smile,1
Purchased at the mall,1
The sickest army doll,1
"I scratch your head, you fall asleep",1
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist,1
"You smoked, then ate seven bars of chocolate",1
"And who's gonna know you, if not me?",1
Who else decodes you?,1
But I've seen this episode and still love the show,1
Throwing spikes down on the road,1
But you're in self-sabotage mode,1
"Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""",1
I think some things I never say,1
"But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you",1
"Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up",1
"But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me",1
"Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up",1
"My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him",1
"Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors",1
'Til you sometimes come and tug my sweater,1
"And for a fortnight, there we were, together running",1
"I touched you, but I touched you",1
"And I love you, it's ruining my life",1
"I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary",1
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February,1
But what about your quiet treason?,1
Like a tattooed golden retriever,1
But you awaken with dread,1
Pounding nails in your head,1
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on,1
Called the rain to end our days of wild,1
The voices in his head,1
"Oh, here we go again",1
Who else decodes you? (Ooh-ooh),1
Gonna know you? Gonna control you?,1
"This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're two idiots",1
"And you're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith",1
Who's gonna know you? (Who?) Me,1
Who's gonna hold you? (Who?) Me,1
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding,1
"At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger",1
But I've read this one where you come undone,1
"So tell me, who else is gonna know me?",1
'Cause we're crazy,1
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be,1
"And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen",1
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave,1
"Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me",1
(Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna control you?),1
(Who's gonna hold you?),1
And who's gonna know you like me?,1
I chose this cyclone with you,1
Like we were in Paris,1
Did you see the photos?,1
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy,1
Just like that,1
You know how much I hate,1
You would break your back to make me break a smile,1
"Break up, break free, break through, break down",1
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind,1
It only feels this raw right now,1
It can't last,1
Never trust it if it rises fast,1
You know how scared I am of elevators,1
I'll be gettin' over you my whole life,1
"Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out",1
Was what I was thinkin' the whole time,1
"""It only hurts this much right now""",1
I polish up nice,1
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?,1
"I polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice",1
I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer),1
A diamond's gotta shine,1
What's a girl gonna do?,1
Just 'cause he was high,1
But some guy said my aura's moonstone,1
Sadness became my whole sky,1
Sapphire tears on my face,1
But I miss sparklin' (Nice),1
That everybody just expects me to bounce back,1
You're talking shit for the hell of it,1
Karma is a god (Ah),1
"Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant",1
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend),1
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend),1
Coming straight home to me,1
Karma is the guy on the screen,1
Karma takes all my friends to the summit,1
"Sweet like justice, karma is a queen",1
"Step by step, from town to town",1
Karma's gonna track you down,1
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter,1
Rattling your ground,1
'Cause karma is the thunder,1
"(I'm still here, I'm still here)",1
"Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here",1
Ask me what I earned from all those tears,1
Ask me what I learned from all those years,1
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?,1
"Trick me once, trick me twice",1
My pennies made your crown,1
Weave your little webs of opacity,1
"Spider boy, king of thieves",1
Of everyone you burned just to get there,1
"'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare",1
You're terrified to look down,1
And I miss you (Miss you),1
I can reclaim the land,1
"I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)",1
I think it's time to teach some lessons,1
I don't dress for men,1
I don't dress for women,1
They say looks can kill and I might try,1
Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie,1
"You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them",1
"Draw the cat eye, sharp enough to kill a man",1
"Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh (More of a fight)",1
Then what did you do? (Do),1
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you),1
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room),1
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?),1
"And right, but tonight",1
"That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable",1
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?,1
Second best after that meteor strike?,1
Does it feel like everything's just like,1
I just may like to have a conversation,1
Got swept away in the grey,1
And you're not sure and I don't know,1
Fuckin' politics and gender roles,1
It was one drink after another,1
But you were on somethin',1
That you saw that night,1
"She needed cold hard proof, so I gave her some",1
"She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?",1
"Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride",1
Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI,1
"Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve",1
"Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)",1
"And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight",1
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five,1
In the shoes I gave you as a present,1
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind,1
"Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind",1
On my vigilante shit again,1
Or for innocents,1
And I don't dress for villains,1
"Well, he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine",1
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife,1
The lady simply had enough,1
Someone sweet and kind and fun,1
Ladies know what people want,1
Ladies always rise above,1
Lately she's been dressing for revenge,1
She don't dress for friends,1
"She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends",1
Lately she's been dressin' for revenge,1
Drivin' in your Benz,1
And she looks so pretty,1
Karma is my boyfriend,1
"Uh-huh, mm",1
"2003, unbearable",1
"Broken and blue, so I called off the troops",1
Your finger on my hair pin triggers,1
Somewhere in the haze got a sense I'd been betrayed,1
It turned into something bigger,1
I vowed not to fight anymore,1
"Uh-huh, the burning embers",1
"Uh-huh, the bombs were close and",1
So I justified it,1
Telling me to punish you for things you never did,1
Screaming from a crypt,1
And maybe it's the past that's talking,1
"But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire",1
You said I have to trust more freely,1
"I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone",1
You drew up some good faith treaties,1
I vowed not to cry anymore,1
"Uh-huh, tears on the letter",1
"Uh-huh, sweet dream was over",1
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur,1
"Maybe, it was her",1
And maybe it was ego swinging,1
"Tore your banners down, took the battle underground",1
Spineless in my tomb of silence,1
"Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep talked",1
"Hold you down on that icy ground, looked up at me with honor and truth",1
That was the night I nearly lost you,1
I spy with my little tired eye,1
I really thought I lost you,1
And all the outfits were terrible,1
Some wannabe Z lister,1
Turns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago,1
Met someone at a club and he kissed her,1
Your ex friend's sister,1
"(What could've been, would've been you)",1
So I'll say words I don't believe,1
"'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be",1
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes,1
Did some force take you because I didn't pray?,1
Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia?,1
"'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea",1
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness,1
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears,1
No words appear before me in the aftermath,1
I would always be yours,1
"Uh-huh, we burn for better",1
"Uh-huh, the worst was over",1
"To that bloodshed, crimson clover",1
And we will never go back,1
"There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair",1
"Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair",1
We can plant a memory garden,1
My knuckles were bruised like violets,1
"Yeah, all you did was smile",1
You knew that I'm a mastermind,1
You knew the entire time,1
At the same time,1
You and I ended up in the same room,1
And all the stars aligned,1
"Once upon a time, the planets and the fates",1
(You're in the kitchen humming),1
(Outside they're push and shoving),1
(Everyone's up to something),1
(They said the end is coming),1
"To you, I can't admit that I'm just too soft for all of it",1
"And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""",1
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other,1
Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors,1
All that you ever wanted from me was nothing,1
'Cause they said the end is coming,1
This happens all the time,1
"You say, ""What a mind""",1
I wrote a poem,1
On the way home,1
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?,1
We almost forgot it,1
Down deep inside your pocket,1
That we picked up last July,1
"Tiny as a firefly, a pebble",1
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse,1
Of a chain reaction of countermoves,1
To assess the equation of you,1
The dominoes cascaded in a line,1
Saw a wide smirk on your face,1
So I told you none of it was accidental,1
'Cause I care,1
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian,1
And I swear,1
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess,1
To make them love me and make it seem effortless,1
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since,1
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid,1
It was all my design,1
I knew I wanted your body,1
"Checkmate, I couldn't lose",1
And the liquor in our cocktails,1
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails,1
Strategy sets the scene for the tale,1
"If you fail to plan, you plan to fail",1
In every lover's game,1
'Cause we were born to be the pawn,1
Had to do it this way,1
"You see, all the wisest women",1
It was all by design,1
The dominoes cascaded in the line,1
"Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing",1
"But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma",1
"You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you",1
"Remember the footsteps, remember the words said",1
"Oh, oh (Never grow up)",1
"Please, try to never grow up",1
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up),1
"Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple",1
"Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little",1
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on,1
It's so much colder than I thought it would be,1
"In a big city, they just dropped me off",1
"So, here I am in my new apartment",1
"I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone",1
And all your little brother's favorite songs,1
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home,1
Not where the storyline ends,1
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room,1
Nothing's ever left you scarred,1
And no one's ever burned you,1
In your PJs getting ready for school,1
And don't lose the way that you dance around,1
"Remember that she's gettin' older, too",1
But don't make her drop you off around the block,1
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots,1
"At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do",1
And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off,1
"You're in the car, on the way to the movies",1
Oh (Never grow up),1
There I was again tonight,1
"Forcing laughter, faking smiles",1
"Same old tired, lonely place",1
This is me praying that,1
"I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone",1
"This night is flawless, don't you let it go",1
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you,1
"""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""",1
I'd open up and you would say,1
Wishing you were at my door,1
"And now, I'm pacing back and forth",1
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake,1
"2AM, who do you love?",1
The lingering question kept me up,1
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you,1
And it was enchanting to meet you,1
Like passing notes in secrecy,1
Counter all your quick remarks,1
The playful conversation starts,1
Starts to make its way to me,1
"Across the room, your silhouette",1
"Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""",1
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you,1
Vanished when I saw your face,1
Shifting eyes and vacancy,1
Walls of insincerity,1
And never grow up,1
And no one will desert you,1
I won't let nobody hurt you,1
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,1
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin' to look busy,1
How'd we end up this way?,1
Next chapter,1
"So many walls up, I can't break through",1
So many things that I wish you knew,1
Miscommunications lead to fallout,1
"Oh, a simple complication",1
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on,1
Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat,1
I used to know my place was the spot next to you,1
"And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""",1
How we met and the sparks flew instantly,1
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,1
"And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah",1
"But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city",1
"And mean, and mean, and mean",1
"And alone in life, and mean",1
"And a liar, and pathetic",1
All you are is mean,1
But all you are is mean,1
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing,1
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things,1
"With that same big, loud opinion but nobody's listening",1
And you're doin' your best to avoid me,1
How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here,1
If you could stay like that,1
But you held your pride like you should've held me,1
"I'd give all I have, honey",1
You got nothing to regret,1
"To you, everything's funny",1
"So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight",1
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming,1
And it's so quiet in the world tonight,1
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger,1
The end,1
'Cause we're goin' down,1
"And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now",1
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate,1
But the story of us might be ending soon,1
So many things that you wish I knew,1
If you said you'd rather love than fight,1
But I would lay my armor down,1
The battle's in your hands now,1
But I liked it better when you were on my side,1
Of who can act like they care less,1
This is looking like a contest,1
I've never heard silence quite this loud,1
"I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how",1
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?,1
"Oh, I'm scared to see the ending",1
This was the very first page,1
My thoughts will echo your name,1
And I can see you years from now in a bar,1
"Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh",1
Won't lose you again,1
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake,1
And I can't trust anything now,1
It's getting dark and it's all so quiet,1
But I never thought I'd live to see it break,1
It's never too late to get it back,1
"Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh",1
"Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh",1
Today is never too late to be brand new,1
I hope you remember,1
Minds change like the weather,1
You'll have new Septembers,1
Until I see you again,1
Time turns flames to embers,1
Before the monsters caught up to you?,1
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep,1
Someone bigger brought down to you,1
When everything out of reach,1
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?,1
If only you had seen what you know now then,1
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now,1
"But at night, you live it all again",1
Did some things you can't speak of,1
And everybody believed in you?,1
Something's made your eyes go cold,1
"Can't turn back now, I'm haunted",1
Stood there and watched you walk away,1
From everything we had,1
"Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane",1
"I do recall now, the smell of the rain",1
Away,1
"You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?",1
The words that you whispered for just us to know,1
Lit through the darkness at 1:58,1
I still remember the look on your face,1
Never thought I'd see it,1
Never ever thought I'd see it break,1
"I can't go back, I'm haunted",1
Won't finish what you started,1
Something's gone terribly wrong (Terribly wrong),1
"You can't be gone, no",1
You're not gone,1
I just know,1
"I know, I know",1
"I can't turn back now, I'm haunted",1
Something keeps me holding onto nothing,1
Won't see you again,1
"But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead",1
And he just might make me smile,1
He will try to take away my pain,1
But I still mean every word I said to you,1
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything,1
Always a bigger bed to crawl into,1
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?,1
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things,1
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it,1
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list,1
"There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge), ha",1
She underestimated just who she was stealin' from,1
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum,1
I underestimated just who I was dealing with (Oh),1
"I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it",1
"She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""",1
"She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause",1
"I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him",1
"The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and",1
"Haha, time for a little revenge",1
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Haha),1
Wonderin' if you knew,1
"I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)",1
Dancing around all alone,1
"I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you)",1
Don't you let it go,1
"This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)",1
"Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you (Oh-oh)",1
"Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)",1
As I was leaving too soon,1
These are the words I held back,1
"I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and",1
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know,1
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back,1
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go,1
Lost your balance on a tightrope,1
Left yourself in your war path,1
I guess you really did it this time,1
"She took him faster than you could say ""Sabotage""",1
'Cause you're so much better,1
So you deserve some applause,1
"(So much better, yeah?)",1
"Come on, show me how much better you are (Oh, oh)",1
"Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)",1
"I don't think you do, I don't think you do",1
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No),1
"'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)",1
(Come on) Do you still feel like you know what you're doin'?,1
There is nothing I do better than revenge,1
"She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)",1
She's not a saint and she's not what you think (No),1
"Woah (Come on, can you take it back? Come on)",1
"You might have him, but I always get the last word",1
"You might have him, but haven't you heard?",1
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Haha),1
(Think about what you did),1
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity,1
They didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me,1
Talking over a football game,1
And you don't know what you don't know,1
"It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms",1
"She is the best thing that's ever been mine""",1
But I kinda know that I won't get far,1
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin',1
And I'm a house of cards,1
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm,1
"Yes, yes, and I can see it (Hold on)",1
"Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on, yeah)",1
"Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)",1
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine,1
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,1
"Hold on, never turn back",1
Hold on and make it last,1
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter,1
"Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times",1
"And every time I look at you, it's like the first time",1
"You said, ""I remember how it felt sitting by the water",1
"You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""",1
Then you took me by surprise,1
'Cause that's all I've ever known,1
Braced myself for the goodbye,1
I ran out cryin' and you followed me out into the street,1
As everything was slippin' right out of our hands,1
"And I remember that fight, 2:30AM",1
"Oh-oh, oh",1
You saw me start to believe for the first time,1
"And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch",1
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of,1
My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea,1
You touch me once and it's really somethin',1
"Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'",1
"These days, I haven't been sleeping",1
"Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""",1
You gave me roses and I left them there to die,1
Is still burned in the back of your mind,1
Because the last time you saw me,1
Your guard is up and I know why,1
"We small talk, work and the weather",1
"You've been good, busier than ever",1
I haven't seen them in a while,1
"How's life? Tell me, how's your family?",1
I'm so glad you made time to see me,1
"Oh, baby, smile",1
"Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain",1
"I'm captivated by you, baby, like a fireworks show",1
"And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?",1
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right,1
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me,1
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild,1
"And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would",1
"But with you, I know it's no good",1
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world,1
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be,1
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?,1
"Yes, yes, this is what I thought about",1
When it was hard to take,1
The picture frame is empty,1
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray,1
This is the last time I'll drive this way again,1
"I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say",1
"The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin",1
It wasn't just like a movie,1
"Don't you (Ah, ah, ah)",1
You don't (You don't) know how much I feel I love you still,1
Don't you (Don't you) say you've,1
"Don't you (Don't you), don't you",1
So if I see you again,1
(But I don't wanna pretend),1
And you can say we're still friends,1
Try to go on with my life,1
So I walk outta here tonight,1
I swore I wouldn't do this,1
My heart knows what the truth is,1
"I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do",1
"Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you",1
"Ah, ah, ah",1
I'm sure she'll make you happy,1
I heard she's nothin' like me,1
"It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare",1
"Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere",1
"'Cause I, I still love you but I can't",1
"On the dresser, vacant just like me",1
We got nothing figured out,1
I see your writing on the dash,1
But we got bills to pay,1
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes,1
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded,1
And there's a drawer of my things at your place,1
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together,1
The moment I could see it,1
As we're lyin' on the couch,1
"I say, ""Can you believe it?""",1
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts,1
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling,1
"Left a small town, never looked back",1
"You were in college working part-time, waitin' tables",1
"Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me",1
And I'm so scared of how this ends,1
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands,1
You're all I want but it's not enough this time,1
And there's so much that I can't touch,1
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past,1
Then the here and the now floods in,1
Guess I never doubted it,1
Everything I thought we'd always have,1
I was so sure of everything,1
Then back to your hesitation,1
When your birthday passed and I didn't call,1
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side,1
'Cause you can't lead me down that road,1
Or maybe it's you and your sick need,1
"All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes",1
Never impressed by me acing your tests,1
"You are an expert at ""Sorry"" and keepin' lines blurry",1
"Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?",1
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by,1
"Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong",1
"""Run as fast as you can""",1
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said,1
Who don't understand,1
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors,1
To give love and take it away,1
"Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame",1
And realized I loved you in the fall,1
And this song is to let you know why,1
"Well, I stopped pickin' up",1
I might get on the phone tonight,1
Wonderin' which version of you,1
But you change the rules every day,1
And I lived in your chess game,1
Then go back to turn it to rain,1
You paint me a blue sky,1
But I swore I was fine,1
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind,1
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again,1
'Cause you burned them out,1
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,1
So don't look now,1
"I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town",1
But the cycle ends right now,1
Somebody made you cold,1
I bet you got pushed around,1
I just wanna feel okay again,1
'Cause I'll never impress you,1
"I walk with my head down, trying to block you out",1
As if I don't already see them,1
You have pointed out my flaws again,1
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation,1
"You, with your switching sides",1
But you don't know what you don't know,1
With just one single blow,1
"Well, you can take me down",1
"You, pickin' on the weaker man",1
Calling me out when I'm wounded,1
"You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard",1
Got me feelin' like a nothing,1
You have knocked me off my feet again,1
And swords and weapons that you use against me,1
"You, with your words like knives",1
Don't you think I was too young?,1
The girl in the dress wrote you a song,1
I see it all now that you're gone,1
Counting my footsteps,1
When my days once revolved around you,1
Long were the nights,1
Fond gestures are exchanged,1
I lose myself in a daydream,1
This is surely not what you thought it would be,1
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry,1
Somewhere back inside a room,1
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,1
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel,1
I sneak in and see your friends,1
Who should be marrying the wrong girl,1
All the time,1
And I go back to December,1
But this is me swallowing my pride,1
"So, if the chain is on your door, I understand",1
"I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't",1
"But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right",1
Probably mindless dreaming,1
Maybe this is wishful thinkin',1
The first time you ever saw me cry,1
And how you held me in your arms that September night,1
"So good to me, so right",1
"I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile",1
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye,1
When fear crept into my mind,1
"And then the cold came, the dark days",1
Where I stand and say,1
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march,1
"When they said, 'Speak now'""",1
And I am hiding in the curtains,1
So glad you were around,1
"Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)",1
"Of my tux, at the back door",1
I'll meet you when I'm out,1
"And you say, ""Let's run away now (Run away now)",1
"They said, ""Speak now""",1
"So, don't say yes, run away now",1
"Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha",1
But I'm only lookin' at you,1
Horrified looks from everyone in the room,1
"I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me",1
"There's the silence, there's my last chance",1
"""Speak now or forever hold your peace""",1
I hear the preacher say,1
"Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh",1
"Ooh (Run away now), la",1
Your time is running out,1
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow),1
"Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)",1
"You wish it was me, don't you?",1
But I know you wish it was me,1
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen,1
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be,1
"That July ninth, the beat of your heart",1
But now I'll go,1
Twenty-two (Dancin' like),1
In a crowded room a few short years ago,1
Busy streets and busy lives,1
I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights,1
"And somethin' in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in",1
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944,1
"We're gonna be timeless, timeless",1
"And you'll say, ""Oh my, we really were timeless""",1
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made,1
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray,1
We're gonna be,1
You're always gonna be mine,1
"And sometimes there's no proof, you just know",1
"The story started when you said, ""Hello""",1
Touching him was like,1
The first time that you saw me,1
It was like an age-old classic,1
Don't you let it touch your soul,1
Time breaks down your mind and body,1
And run away and left it all behind,1
And I was forced to marry another man,1
In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land,1
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face,1
"Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did",1
Story of a romance torn apart by fate,1
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs,1
"And all we know, is touch and go",1
We are alone with our changin' minds,1
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds,1
Or fades in time,1
"Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all",1
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall,1
"Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly",1
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street,1
"Be the same, yeah, oh-oh, oh",1
And I'll never,1
Of something good and right and real,1
This is the golden age,1
You're my Achilles heel,1
These are the hands of fate,1
But this love is brave and wild,1
Mosaic broken hearts,1
We learn to live with the pain,1
And I've loved in shades of wrong,1
So you were never a saint,1
"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes",1
Up in your room and our slates are clean,1
"We are alone, just you and me",1
Now all we know is don't let go,1
Pierce the room like a cannonball,1
You come around and the armor falls,1
Be the same,1
And I'll never (I'll never),1
At these precious things that time forgot,1
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round,1
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop,1
"Ooh, you will learn the hard way now",1
La-la-la-la-la,1
"La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh",1
"You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh",1
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson,1
And you will say you had the best of intentions,1
"I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring",1
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings,1
And the voices in my head are tellin' me why,1
But goodbye screamin' in the silence,1
"Oh, you haven't written me or called",1
"Sayin', ""How could I not see the signs?""",1
Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands,1
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out,1
"But then the voices say, ""You are not the exception",1
Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news,1
This is something we'll laugh about,1
"And maybe, someday, when we're older",1
It starts thinkin' you'll come around,1
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder,1
"And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof",1
But I know I can't call you mine,1
Don't know what to call this situation,1
I know how to act like I'm fine,1
Ain't never gonna come,1
Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love,1
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you,1
They ain't never gonna come,1
And the date on the back said 1958,1
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance,1
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway,1
I had to smile when it caught my eye,1
And you would've been fine,1
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right,1
And you were headed off to fight in the war,1
On a crowded street in 1944,1
"In another life, you still would've turned my head even if we'd met",1
"And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other",1
"But in those photos, I saw us instead",1
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain,1
The kind you don't put down,1
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime,1
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house,1
"Black and white, saw a '30s bride",1
"And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""",1
On the counter was a cardboard box,1
"And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in",1
"No, he just wasn't the one",1
"When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one",1
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love,1
"And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out",1
"Missing him was dark gray, all alone",1
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you,1
"And the voices say, ""You are not the exception",1
That you never loved me,1
Just to break me like a promise,1
And you call me up again,1
And maybe we got lost in translation,1
"I remember it all too well, yeah",1
"You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me",1
"Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)",1
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh),1
So shame on me now (Knew it right there),1
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there),1
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been),1
"Or her, or anyone, or anything",1
Comes creeping in,1
Memorizing him was as,1
And the saddest fear,1
"Oh, oh-oh (Yeah)",1
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah),1
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh),1
"And I realize the joke is on me, hey",1
He was long gone when he met me,1
"And now I see, now I see, now I see",1
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be,1
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street,1
"You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning",1
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why,1
Too well,1
To dress up like hipsters,1
And make fun of our exes,1
For breakfast at midnight,1
We just keep dancin' like we're (Dance like we're twenty-two),1
You don't know about me (You don't know about me),1
"Everything will be alright if (Ooh, oh-oh)",1
I don't know about you (I don't know about you),1
"Yeah, hey, yeah",1
"Ooh, oh",1
Twenty-two (Ooh),1
Twenty-two (I don't know about you),1
"Twenty-two (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)",1
Everything will be alright if (Alright),1
Everything will be alright if (Ooh),1
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks,1
"It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah",1
"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way",1
Instead of sleepin',1
And end up dreamin',1
"Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew)",1
Too many cool kids,1
This place is too crowded,1
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines,1
"It's miserable and magical, oh yeah",1
"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time",1
To fall in love with strangers,1
"No apologies, he'll never see you cry",1
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in,1
And I realize the blame is on me,1
As long as they don't touch,1
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street,1
"(Red, red, red; red, red, red) Yeah, yeah",1
"Comes back to me (Red, red, red; red, red, red), burning red",1
"And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red, red; red, red, red)",1
"Burning red (Red, red, red; red, red, red)",1
"Yeah, yeah, red",1
'Cause loving him was red,1
"Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known",1
Loving him was red,1
In burning red,1
When I still see it all in my head,1
But moving on from him is impossible,1
"Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go",1
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes,1
"Burning red (Red, red, red)",1
"Oh, red (Red, red, red)",1
Trying to know somebody you never met,1
Forgetting him was like,1
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong,1
Regretting him was like,1
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer,1
Fighting with him was like,1
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song,1
Put your lips close to mine,1
"Out of focus, eye to eye",1
And he's long gone when he's next to me,1
'Til the gravity's too much,1
"Without me, without me, without me",1
"And when I fell hard, you took a step back",1
"I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that",1
"You found me, you found me, you found me",1
"I was in your sights, you got me alone",1
"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago",1
I-I-I like it,1
"I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I",1
This daydream is dangerous,1
"I, I, I like it (Oh)",1
But you're friction,1
Forever going with the flow,1
Trained to get along,1
All we are is skin and bone,1
Asking you to stay,1
I hear the sound of my own voice,1
Getting swept away,1
I can't decide if it's a choice,1
And I-I-I like it,1
But you're quicksand,1
And I'd be smart to walk away,1
If you say it with your hands,1
And I'll do anything you say,1
You know how to keep me waitin',1
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head,1
I do remember the swing of your step,1
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves,1
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you,1
"Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and",1
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and,1
And you'll say,1
"But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine",1
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,1
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,1
You never know what people have up their sleeves,1
"The jury's out, but my choice is you",1
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,1
They'll judge it like they know about me and you,1
"But right now, my time is theirs",1
I'm love-struck and looking out the window,1
"If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares",1
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs,1
Elevator buttons and morning air,1
"And long, long live that look on your face",1
"Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""",1
"And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""",1
"Long, long live the walls we crashed through",1
I had the time of my life with you,1
Tell 'em how I hope they shine,1
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild,1
"Please, tell 'em my name",1
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,1
And I love the riddles that you speak,1
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos,1
"Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours",1
"Don't forget, don't forget about me",1
And I hope you don't save some other girl,1
And I watch you fly around the world,1
I loved you from the very first day,1
"And you'll leave, got places to be, and I'll be okay",1
And I can't hear one single word they say,1
He's not all bad like his reputation,1
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin',1
"But I hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah",1
"He's complicated, he's irrational",1
"Tall, dark and beautiful",1
I love you forever,1
"And I'll say, ""Just fine""",1
"And you smile and say, ""How are you?""",1
"I hang on every word you say, yay",1
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him,1
"He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition",1
It's the same thing to me,1
To save the world or go to work,1
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away,1
"Tall, dark, and superman",1
They can't take what's ours,1
But they can't take what's ours,1
When they point to the pictures,1
If you have children some day,1
And force us into a goodbye,1
We were the kings and the queens,1
The time we stood with our shaking hands,1
In the back of my mind,1
"I said, ""Remember this moment""",1
Just like our last,1
Just like our last kiss,1
So I'll go,1
But I never planned on you changing your mind,1
You can plan for a change in the weather and time,1
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed,1
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day,1
Hope it's nice where you are,1
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are,1
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe,1
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep,1
"Your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm",1
And I'll go,1
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions,1
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something,1
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets,1
Because I love your handshake meetin' my father,1
"I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did",1
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in,1
"The life of the party, you're showin' off again",1
The crowds in stands went wild,1
And they read off our names,1
"But if, God forbid, fate should step in",1
The night you danced like you knew our lives would,1
That you'll stand by me forever,1
Will you take a moment? Promise me this,1
May these memories break our fall,1
Confetti falls to the ground,1
Hold on to spinning around,1
"I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""",1
Long live all the mountains we moved,1
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world,1
"'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves",1
"Screaming, ""This is absurd""",1
And the cynics were outraged,1
And we held them up for our town,1
When they gave us our trophies,1
You traded your baseball cap for a crown,1
We are the kings and the queens,1
Wishin' for right now,1
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines,1
I pass the pictures around,1
"I said, ""Remember this feeling""",1
But the start of an age,1
It was the end of a decade,1
You held your head like a hero on a history book page,1
Never be the same,1
"I'm far away, but I never let you go",1
"Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be",1
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right,1
"Passed me a note saying, ""Meet me tonight""",1
"(Uh-uh, uh, uh) I see you, I see you, baby",1
I see you,1
"Oh, I see you, I see you, baby",1
"That I can see you, oh, I can see you",1
"And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh",1
I can see you waitin' down the hall from me,1
"Oh-oh, oh, oh",1
Hide away and I will start behaving myself,1
You can see me as a secret mission,1
And I could see you being my addiction,1
"Then we kissed and you know I won't ever tell, yeah",1
I can see you in your suit and your necktie,1
"Right here, wishing the flowers were from you",1
"And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh",1
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet,1
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head,1
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet,1
They keep watchful eyes on us,1
"But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like",1
And we kept everything professional,1
"And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew",1
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it,1
I've been watchin' you for ages,1
"And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?",1
"Oh, baby",1
"Once, I had an empire in a golden age",1
"I was held up so high, I used to be great",1
They used to cheer when they saw my face,1
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high,1
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again,1
"Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans",1
"My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand",1
"You don't wanna know me now, now",1
"And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down (Just let you down)",1
Never wanted you to hate me,1
Now they're screaming that they hate me,1
Used to chant my name,1
Now they're screamin' at the palace's front gates,1
People look at me like I'm a monster,1
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor,1
I don't know how it could've ended this way,1
My foes and friends watch my reign end,1
Falling down like promises that I never kept,1
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret,1
"Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off",1
Power went to my head and I couldn't stop,1
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart,1
"Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far",1
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me,1
"Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty",1
"Now, I fear I have fallen from grace",1
You brush past me in the hallway,1
"Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her",1
"Little does he know, his whole world's about to change",1
It's 8:05 and I see two headlights,1
And just one time (Just one time),1
Or string me along while you decide,1
And you won't need space,1
And maybe I call you mine,1
Maybe the stars align (Just one time),1
I was thinking just one time (Just one time),1
"Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right",1
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone,1
I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone,1
"'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)",1
I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying,1
I've been left in the rain lost and pining,1
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me,1
Got a history of stories ending sadly,1
I've got my money on things goin' badly,1
Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight,1
Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway,1
"Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay",1
"I swear, I'll be with you someday",1
Forever and ever,1
'Cause I loved you from the very first day,1
Wishing the call was from you,1
Wishing the card was from you,1
Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right),1
Got a feelin' your electric touch (Ooh),1
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains,1
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life (Life),1
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand,1
Emma met a boy with eyes like a man,1
"When Emma falls in love, I'm learning",1
"'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place",1
She won't lose herself in love the way that I did,1
"Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A.  ",1
And she's the kind of book that you can't put down,1
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave,1
"'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps",1
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own,1
"When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone",1
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years,1
"When Emma falls in love, she disappears",1
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space,1
"When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face",1
That boy will never be the same,1
"When Emma falls in love, I know",1
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain,1
She waits and takes her time,1
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong,1
"When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom",1
Closes the blinds and locks the door,1
"When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor",1
"That's when I love you, that's when",1
"(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)",1
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate,1
"""You know, I haven't seen you around before""",1
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one,1
And you're feelin' like flyin',1
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car,1
We'll be outta here as soon as we can,1
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool,1
"And soon enough, you're best friends",1
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail,1
Fifteen,1
This is life before you know who you're gonna be,1
"Well, count to ten, take it in",1
"And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out",1
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,1
See you make your way through the crowd,1
For the next four years in this town,1
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here,1
Try and stay out of everybody's way,1
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while,1
It's the mornin' of your very first day,1
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors,1
"Oh-oh, yeah",1
It's fearless,1
"It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something",1
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave,1
"My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but",1
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends,1
When the night ends,1
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss,1
Makes your head spin 'round,1
On a balcony in summer air,1
I'm standing there,1
I close my eyes and the flashback starts,1
We were both young when I first saw you,1
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors,1
"Take a deep breath, girl",1
Your very first day,1
"La-la-la, la-la-la",1
At fifteen,1
I didn't know who I was supposed to be,1
And you just might find who you're supposed to be,1
I've found time can heal most anything,1
"And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall",1
And we both cried,1
To a boy who changed his mind,1
And Abigail gave everything she had,1
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine,1
"Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday",1
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now,1
When all you wanted was to be wanted,1
But I didn't know it at fifteen,1
Dating the boy on the football team,1
But in your life you'll do things greater than,1
"Well, you stood there with me in the doorway",1
"In this moment now, capture it, remember it",1
You put your eyes on me,1
"Oh, we're invisible",1
If you only knew me,1
And everything that we could be,1
And all I think about is how to make you think of me,1
No matter what you do,1
She's never gonna see the light,1
That can't help but shine through,1
There's a fire inside of you,1
And I just wanna show you,1
But you are everything to me,1
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her,1
Whenever she walks by,1
She'll never notice how you stop and stare,1
And I wrote down our song,1
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin,1
"Oh, oh, yeah",1
"Play it again, oh, yeah",1
"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""",1
Our song is the way he laughs,1
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know,1
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow,1
"Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window",1
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,1
That was as good as our song,1
Like shadows in a faded light,1
I just wanna open your eyes,1
"I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat",1
And make you realize,1
"So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one-horse town",1
And I don't know how it gets better than this,1
Absent-mindedly making me want you,1
"But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair",1
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now,1
"We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know",1
"In the middle of the parking lot, yeah",1
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there,1
"There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car",1
The street looks when it's just rained,1
There's something 'bout the way,1
Why would you wanna break? Why would you wanna break it?,1
How do I get it back the way it was before?,1
It's not unbroken anymore,1
"It don't make sense to me, but",1
That you would walk away,1
"No matter what you say, I still can't believe",1
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall,1
Should've read the writing on the wall,1
Maybe I should've seen the signs,1
You just see right through me,1
Let me want you,1
"Baby, let me love you",1
"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns",1
"And say, ""Hello""",1
"I've heard every album, listened to the radio",1
I had so many dreams about you and me,1
And it's too late for you and your white horse,1
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now,1
"This is a big world, that was a small town",1
Who might actually treat me well,1
I'm gonna find someone someday,1
"'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale",1
But I'm so sorry,1
Just like I always wanted,1
"Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me",1
And there you are on your knees,1
"Happy endings, now I know",1
You had to fight to have the upper hand,1
Little did I know,1
"My mistake, I didn't know to be in love",1
And never really had a chance,1
"Maybe I was na√Øve, got lost in your eyes",1
"Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known",1
"Holdin' on, the days drag on",1
'Cause I honestly believed in you,1
As I paced back and forth all this time,1
Comes out just when you need it to,1
"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel",1
I can't help myself,1
"Mmm-mm, I can't help myself",1
To catch me now,1
"Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa",1
"Try and catch me now, oh",1
It's too late to catch me now,1
And you tell me 'bout your dreams,1
I know your favorite songs,1
When you know you're 'bout to cry,1
I'm the one who makes you laugh,1
"Oh, I remember you driving to my house",1
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find,1
"She wears high heels, I wear sneakers",1
"Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?",1
"You say you're fine, I know you better than that",1
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down,1
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town,1
"Hey, isn't this easy?",1
"Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself",1
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be,1
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans,1
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find,1
"'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts",1
And she'll never know your story like I do,1
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like,1
"I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night",1
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do,1
She's going off about something that you said,1
"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset",1
"Ah-uh, myself",1
If you look like an angel,1
I can't help it if you look like an angel,1
"It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""",1
I love you and that's all I really know,1
"""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone",1
"He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said",1
"Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""",1
"I keep waiting for you, but you never come",1
"And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone",1
When I met you on the outskirts of town,1
My faith in you was fading,1
Wondering if you were ever coming around,1
And I got tired of waiting,1
"Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess",1
"This love is difficult, but it's real",1
"Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel",1
"I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said",1
But you were everything to me,1
"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter",1
"Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh",1
So close your eyes,1
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew,1
So I sneak out to the garden to see you,1
"Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said",1
And I was crying on the staircase,1
"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles",1
"I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress",1
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you,1
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha-ha),1
"Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah",1
"All those other girls, well, they're beautiful",1
Why I should be the one you choose,1
"Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons",1
"And pull me near and shine, shine, shine",1
"I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out",1
Why aren't you here tonight?,1
"They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me",1
I think you and I should stay the same,1
"Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?",1
"It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change",1
"The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name",1
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do,1
"I've seen it all, so I thought",1
So I got some things to say to you,1
"Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling",1
I don't always have to be alone,1
"Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing",1
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold,1
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window,1
I didn't say half the things I wanted to,1
And as we walked we were talking,1
But I know I saw a light in you,1
"Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving",1
Waited for somethin' to come along,1
Da-da-da-da,1
"When I'm laughing, when I'm crying",1
And he's all that I need to fall into,1
"And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah",1
Could you tell me what more do I need,1
"Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine",1
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve,1
"Got the radio on, my old blue jeans",1
Who feels the way I do,1
Even though I'm not the only one,1
Trying to see through the rain coming down,1
"Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking",1
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out,1
"I don't know what I want, so don't ask me",1
"He's the time taken up, but there's never enough",1
"You saw me there, but never knew",1
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart,1
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,1
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight,1
"So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light",1
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause,1
"She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love",1
The kind of flawless I wish I could be,1
"And there he goes, so perfectly",1
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?,1
Drew walks by me,1
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night,1
But that's OK,1
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission,1
But I'm ready to fly,1
"Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know",1
But nothing seems to work the first few times,1
I tried to take the road less traveled by,1
"And, baby, I've got nowhere to go",1
I didn't read between the lines,1
"When I went looking for a reason, I know",1
I didn't know what I would find,1
Counting all the scars you made,1
Every smile you fake is so condescending,1
(Died for you),1
"And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you",1
"You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you",1
"So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say",1
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you,1
And you come away with a great little story,1
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away,1
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray,1
"Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say",1
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted,1
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something,1
"And when you take, you take the very best of me",1
You have a way of coming easily to me,1
"Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh",1
"Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world",1
"He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right",1
Anyone when he's with me,1
That I can't even see,1
"State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy",1
Mmmm,1
"Oh, think of me",1
"I hope it takes you back to that place""",1
Someday you'll turn your radio on,1
"""When you think Tim McGraw",1
And the first thing that you'll read is:,1
And there's a letter left on your doorstep,1
I'm standin' on your street,1
And I'm back for the first time since then,1
"And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe",1
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet,1
From three summers back,1
Is a letter that you never read,1
But in a box beneath my bed,1
To see me like that,1
And thankin' God that you weren't here,1
September saw a month of tears,1
But when you think Tim McGraw,1
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone,1
And I was right there beside him all summer long,1
On backroads at night,1
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,1
Just a boy in a Chevy truck,1
He said the way my blue eyes shine,1
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me,1
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny,1
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy,1
Drew talks to me,1
And she's got everything that I have to live without,1
"I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about",1
Everything that we should be,1
That I want and I'm needing,1
"Baby, burn",1
You're just another picture to burn,1
"Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn",1
"You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying",1
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive,1
I really really hate that,1
In case you haven't heard,1
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health,1
"And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself",1
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be,1
And if you come around saying sorry to me,1
From going out with all of your best friends,1
There's nothing stopping me,1
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge,1
There's no time for tears,1
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive,1
By the way,1
"That's fine, you won't mind if I say",1
Am I right?,1
I would give it all up to be,1
And the note that said,1
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried,1
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight,1
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight,1
"Two A.M. riding in your truck, and all I need is you next to me",1
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up,1
"And said, ""Oh my, my, my""",1
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes,1
They never believed we'd really fall in love,1
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights,1
I wasn't that little girl you used to see,1
"Well, I was sixteen when suddenly",1
"Just two kids, you and I",1
Take me back when our world was one block wide,1
"A part of this, a part of you",1
"You never did, you never did",1
"Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me",1
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree,1
"And rolled their eyes and said, ""Oh my, my, my""",1
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled,1
"In the sky, the pretty lights",1
I looked at you like the stars that shined,1
"She said, I was seven and you were nine",1
"No no, no, no, no, no",1
Was she worth this?,1
Was it worth it?,1
You stayed outside 'til the morning light,1
A few years had gone and come around,1
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,1
"And you looked at me, got down on one knee",1
I almost didn't notice all the roses,1
To my lovin' bed,1
"Got to the hallway, well on my way",1
And lost and thrown away,1
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on,1
After everything that day,1
I was walking up the front porch steps,1
And he says,1
"How we don't have a song""",1
"I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'",1
"He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""",1
"I look around, turn the radio down",1
The other on my heart,1
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,1
"In the sky, oh my, my, my",1
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine,1
I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine,1
"After all this time, you and I",1
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch,1
Take me home where we met so many years before,1
"You said ""I do"" and I did too",1
Our whole town came and our mamas cried,1
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle,1
Before you go tell me this,1
I can't resist,1
"You say that the past is the past, you need one chance",1
These pretty girls on every corner,1
"He smiles, it's like the radio",1
Corey's eyes are like a jungle,1
"With a smile, baby, baby",1
"Goodbye, baby",1
But you're coming undone oh,1
You're tied together with a smile,1
That you cry but you don't tell anyone,1
"Oh, ooh-oh",1
It's not his price to pay,1
"Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay",1
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain,1
Hoping it will end up in his pocket,1
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change,1
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted,1
"But that's not true, 'cause I know you",1
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,1
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you,1
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,1
Oh yeah,1
Late to do anything,1
But no one notices until it's too,1
You could've helped if you had wanted to,1
And now it's all too late so you see,1
He whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows,1
"They watch him as he's walking home, saying, ""Does he know?""",1
We could ever be the same?,1
Will you ever know?,1
But do you honestly expect me to believe,1
"Baby, you know all the right things to say",1
You can see that I've been crying,1
"You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance",1
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong,1
Yesterday I found out about you,1
"The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone",1
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing,1
"Na, na, na, na, na",1
"Oh, oh, oh, oh",1
La la la,1
Will you stay,1
I hope your life will lead you back to my front door,1
At least you'll know,1
I'll never get to hold,1
If what you are is a daydream,1
That never gets told,1
If you and I are a story,1
"Hey, by the way",1
I should say,1
It's hard to make a conversation when he's taking my breath away,1
I'm taking pictures in my mind so I can save them for a rainy day,1
Corey finds another way to be the highlight of my day,1
Think I know where you belong,1
Think I know it's with me,1
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you,1
"Oh, babe, if you know everything",1
And the conversation with the little white lies,1
With your face and the beautiful eyes,1
"I said, ""Leave,"" but, baby, all I want is you",1
But what I mean is,1
"To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it""",1
"I say, ""There's nothing you can say",1
"I don't need you but I do, I do, I do",1
I can't even look at you,1
And I'll scream out the window,1
"When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah",1
Tell me why you couldn't see,1
And all the things that I misread,1
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls,1
And I remember the slamming door,1
I keep goin' back over things we both said,1
"Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone",1
Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone,1
But if you look a little closer,1
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over,1
But I'm not picking up,1
And you've called a hundred times,1
"I said, ""This time I've had enough""",1
Tryna make me stay,1
Ignorin' words that you were sayin',1
And the faded picture of a beautiful night,1
You carried me from your car up the stairs,1
"And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?",1
After everything and that little black dress,1
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads,1
"Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do",1
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement,1
"Oh, oh, yeah, oh-oh",1
I can't put this down,1
Did you feel it?,1
It's beating in my chest,1
I can feel my heart,1
"Whenever you're around, yeah",1
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face,1
Is now it's getting so much clearer,1
All that I can say,1
"Every move you make, everything you say is right",1
That takes me to another planet,1
You've got a smile,1
Can you feel this magic in the air?,1
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess,1
You wore a dark gray t-shirt,1
I wore a dress,1
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six,1
I used to be a damsel in distress,1
You were the prince,1
"After everything I must confess, I need you",1
In the heat of the fight I walked away,1
Superstar,1
"Sweet, sweet superstar",1
But I don't wanna have to go that far,1
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name,1
And let me know what you find,1
Talk to the man with the reasons why,1
"Talk to the wind, talk to the sky",1
And I know all the steps up to your door,1
"They're spelling out your name, oh",1
"Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh",1
"Come on, come on",1
"You got to come on, come on, oh",1
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream,1
"Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh",1
"Come on, come on, come on",1
"Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone",1
"Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh",1
I'm caught up in you,1
"And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone",1
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway,1
It's half full and I won't wait here all day,1
"And when you're close, I feel like coming undone",1
"Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun",1
"I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you",1
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why,1
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky,1
I could stand up and sing you a song,1
"And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart",1
Every night from the radio,1
And you don't even know where I start,1
"And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep",1
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are,1
"You played in bars, you play guitar",1
I'd be counting down the ways to see you,1
And I knew when I saw your face,1
You'll be in another town,1
When my world wakes up today,1
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you,1
Morning loneliness,1
I can't keep my eyes off of you,1
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you,1
And I knew from the first note played,1
Help but wish I could see your face,1
Misty morning comes again and I can't,1
There ain't nothing more right babe,1
This is wrong but I can't help but feel like,1
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games,1
I don't know what else I can say,1
"I've watched you so long, screamed your name",1
"'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name, oh",1
And don't wait for the sky to clear,1
Talk to the man who put you here,1
"Talk to yourself, talk to the tears",1
"They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you",1
"You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be",1
Have you ever thought just maybe,1
"Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore",1
Words were hard to hear,1
And I knew my,1
You watched me go,1
"To think about all of this""",1
"When I said, ""I need some time, need some space",1
"You said, ""I know""",1
Oh-oh-oh-oh,1
And you were gonna marry me,1
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm,1
'Cause we were happy,1
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for,1
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy,1
"But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in",1
That's sorta how I feel right now,1
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water,1
"You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it",1
"I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus",1
Back when we had all night and we were happy,1
Before I had somewhere to be,1
When the porch lights were shining bright,1
We used to walk along the streets,1
You said you'd never go away,1
"Mr. ""Look me in the eye and told me you would never go away""",1
You're perfectly fine,1
And harder to ever take back,1
"And I said, ""When can I-I-I come back?""",1
And you said that's when,1
"And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate",1
"That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)",1
"You let me in, and baby, that's when""",1
"That's when, when I saw your face",1
"And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate",1
Laughing when I was crying,1
"That's when, it was sunny or storming",1
"""That's when, when I woke up in the morning",1
"Did you ever think of me?""",1
When you were gone,1
"And you said, ""Honestly",1
"I'll let you in, and baby, that's when""",1
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate,1
"And I said, that's when",1
"And you said, ""When can I-I-I come back?""",1
"And I said, ""Leave those all in our past""",1
Came all your tears,1
Then through the phone,1
"And put you through all of this"" (through all of this)",1
Made mistakes,1
"When you said, ""I did you wrong",1
"I said, ""I know""",1
"Mm, mm",1
"I'll let you in, and baby, that's when",1
I've been Miss Misery for the last time,1
"Goodbye, Mr. ""Casually cruel""",1
"Goodbye, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""",1
"But that was when I got to know Mr. ""Change of heart""",1
"Mr. ""I've been waitin' for you all my life""",1
Everything was right,1
"Mr. ""Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away""",1
"Mr. ""Here to stay""",1
"Mr. ""Perfect face""",1
Still got you all over me,1
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean,1
And I watched a part of myself die,1
"So I lied, and I cried",1
Were never really meant to be,1
And see that we,1
And found out what it was to turn around,1
"I lived, and I learned",1
"And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned",1
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then,1
And I melted like a child,1
"Well I did, so I smiled",1
"And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin",1
With your hands in your pockets,1
Was the one that I met you,1
The best and worst day of June,1
"I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned",1
"You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me",1
"Mr. ""Every single day until the end, I will be by your side""",1
"Mr. ""Leaves me all alone,"" I fall apart",1
"But by then, you'll be Mr. ""Too late""",1
It takes everything in me just to get up each day,1
And someday maybe you'll miss me,1
"Now I'm Miss ""Gonna be alright someday""",1
"'Cause I was Miss ""Here to stay""",1
It's such a shame,1
And it's really such a shame,1
So far above feeling anything,1
So far above me in every sense,1
"Oh, he's so smug, Mr. ""Always wins""",1
"It's the best seat, in the best room",1
Sashay your way to your seat,1
"So strategized, all the eyes on you",1
So dignified in your well-pressed suit,1
But it's wonderful to see that it never fazed you,1
And I never got past what you put me through,1
"I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her",1
'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl,1
"Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same",1
Forgets he ever even heard my name,1
He goes about his day,1
"Mr. ""Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy""",1
"Mr. ""Never had to see me cry""",1
"Mr. ""Never told me why""",1
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay,1
"Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah",1
"You can jump then fall, jump then fall",1
"Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you",1
"Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no",1
And he calls exactly when he says he will,1
And never makes me wait,1
He respects my space,1
You're so in love that you act insane,1
And I feel perfectly fine,1
"And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight""",1
He opens up my door and I get into his car,1
I couldn't ask for anything better,1
He says everything I need to hear and it's like,1
And all my single friends are jealous,1
He is sensible and so incredible,1
"Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh",1
And every time you're here,1
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no",1
There's nothing left to beg for,1
So you don't have to call anymore,1
"You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade",1
"And it never would've gone away, no",1
"You had me crawling for you, honey",1
But you don't have to call anymore,1
'Cause it's worked each time before,1
And now you're asking me to listen,1
"And I'm tired of being last to know, oh",1
And you've got your share of secrets,1
He's close to my mother,1
Talks business with my father,1
He's charming and endearing,1
And I'm comfortable,1
'Cause it seems to me,1
Were you just kidding?,1
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me,1
I hold onto the night,1
And we caught onto something,1
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye,1
Once upon a time,1
Never knew I could feel that much,1
"Oh, oh, oh, whoa",1
"And that's the way I loved you oh, oh, oh, oh",1
"Whoa, whoa, oh-oh, oh",1
"And that's the way I loved you oh, oh",1
I'm so in love that I acted insane,1
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name,1
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain,1
Got away by some mistake and now,1
"Intoxicating, complicated",1
Just so frustrating,1
And you were wild and crazy,1
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all,1
And my heart's not breaking,1
He can't see the smile I'm faking,1
You're so in love that you acted insane,1
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold,1
"You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know",1
You don't have to call anymore,1
"You took a swing, I took it hard",1
"I took a chance, I took a shot",1
I'm sorry,1
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh, ooh)",1
"I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry",1
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)",1
"I can't breathe without you, but I have to",1
"Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh",1
"Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me",1
"Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me",1
Breathe without you but I have to,1
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout,1
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out,1
"Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve",1
"Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt",1
Now I don't know what to be without you around,1
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,1
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see,1
The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie,1
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time,1
People are people and sometimes we change our minds,1
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way,1
I see your face in my mind as I drive away,1
You belong with me?,1
"And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not",1
"And down here from the ground, I see who you are",1
"And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around",1
I'm feeling like I don't know you,1
"And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out",1
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down,1
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around,1
Now you know,1
I told you I'm not bulletproof,1
"I take a step back, I let you go",1
Tell me why (Oh),1
Tell me why (Why),1
"You ask me for my love, then you push me around",1
I've got no one to believe in,1
"You tell me that you want me, then cut me down",1
Feeling like I don't know you,1
So you're the only thing on my mind?,1
Why do you have to put down my dreams,1
So you can feel whole inside?,1
Why do you have to make me feel small,1
"You tell me that you want me, then push me around",1
I got no one to believe in,1
"Forget what I'm tryin' to say, oh",1
"Well, I get so confused and frustrated",1
How to ruin someone's perfect day,1
"Well, you could write a book on",1
"You tell me that you love me, then cut me down",1
"This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak",1
I don't feel welcome anymore,1
"Baby, what happened? Please tell me",1
I realize your laugh is the best sound,1
I like the way you sound in the morning,1
Hallelujah,1
"And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah",1
'Cause we never gave in,1
"It's a revolution, throw your hands up",1
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down,1
Can you see it now?,1
It was the night things changed,1
But we'll stand up champions tonight,1
"And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives",1
Fight for what we've worked for all these years,1
"Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees",1
'Cause these things will change,1
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this,1
"You can walk away, say we don't need this",1
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared,1
"We're getting stronger now, find things they never found",1
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair,1
"So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered",1
Because these things will change,1
And I'll do anything to see it through,1
But I believe in whatever you do,1
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it,1
We're on the phone and without a warning,1
I have ever heard,1
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and,1
I like the way I can't keep my focus,1
"And every time you shine, I shine",1
"Jump then fall into me, into me",1
"Jump then fall, baby",1
"Don't be afraid, please",1
"Whoa oh, I need you, baby",1
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile,1
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry,1
I'll catch you,1
When people say things that bring you to your knees,1
"I'll catch you, I'll catch you",1
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet,1
"'Cause every time you smile, I smile",1
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me,1
And all I can say is come closer,1
I had time to think it over,1
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted,1
"I've never been so wrapped up, honey",1
"I love each freckle on your face, oh",1
You got the keys to me,1
"Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face",1
We should be together,1
I hear the words but all I can think is,1
"I watch you talk, you didn't notice",1
"You know it's all the same, another time and place",1
"Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you",1
'Cause one second it was perfect,1
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall,1
"Look now, the sky is gold",1
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides,1
"I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run",1
"I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on",1
"You said, ""forever and always,"" yeah",1
You didn't mean it baby,1
And it rains in your bedroom,1
"And you flashback to when we said, ""forever and always""",1
"Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called",1
'Cause it rains in your bedroom,1
"Back up, baby, back up",1
"Oh, back up, baby, back up",1
"You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so",1
"Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore",1
Where is this going?,1
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core,1
So here's to everything coming down to nothing,1
"Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure",1
I looked into your eyes,1
Like a scared little boy?,1
"Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide",1
Was I out of line?,1
Now you're halfway out the door,1
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home,1
But I know you're not scared of anything at all,1
That I had the best day with you today,1
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away,1
"And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say",1
For staying back and watching me shine,1
And I love you for giving me your eyes,1
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong,1
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall,1
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world,1
Daddy's smart,1
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves,1
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me,1
There is a video I found from back when I was three,1
And I had the best days with you,1
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run,1
He's better than I am,1
"God smiles on my little brother, inside and out",1
"I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger",1
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay,1
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you,1
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school,1
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names,1
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away,1
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys,1
And don't know how my friends could be so mean,1
I'm thirteen now,1
"Twenty-two (Ooh, woah-oh-oh-oh)",1
"Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah)",1
"I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)",1
"Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door",1
"You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby",1
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor,1
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters,1
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later,1
You still wouldn't go,1
I slept all alone (Uh-huh),1
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh),1
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh),1
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?),1
That my life would be ruined,1
You don't knock anymore and I always knew it,1
You don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined,1
"I see nothing better, I keep him forever",1
"Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door",1
And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever,1
When you told me we'd get back together,1
We were born to be national treasures,1
I know that you still remember,1
And I can still see you now,1
I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium,1
With the pages ripped out,1
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries,1
Walkin' in with you,1
When I ended up back at our class reunion,1
(Is it? Is it? Is it?),1
When you lost control (Uh-huh),1
"Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)",1
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh),1
"Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though",1
"Holdin' him for ransom, some",1
"But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom",1
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted,1
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him,1
But no,1
"I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)",1
"And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)",1
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there,1
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh),1
"Flashin' lights, oh, Lord (Oh)",1
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin'),1
"Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'",1
Think I didn't see you?,1
(Is it? Is it?),1
"You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby",1
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh),1
"If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)",1
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh),1
Just to see you come runnin',1
"Oh Lord, I think about jumpin'",1
And did you think I didn't see you?,1
Your new girl is my clone,1
Would surprise the whole school,1
I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs,1
And when it came to you,1
You didn't have to change,1
It looks like you're tryin' lives on,1
And from the outside,1
You got new icons,1
You grew your hair long,1
I guess I'll never ever know,1
On the way home?,1
Did you get anxious though,1
Don't even get me started,1
You part the crowd like the Red Sea,1
I heard from everybody,1
You went to a party,1
Why'd you whisper in the dark,1
Why'd you have to lead me on? (Oh),1
You say nothin' back,1
"I said, ""I love you"" (I said, ""I love you"")",1
Make me love you (Make me love you)?,1
Give me nothin' back?,1
Make me want you (Make me want you)?,1
I'm about to fold unless you,1
I'm tryna see the cards that you won't show,1
I wait for you to drive by,1
I'm standin' on the sidewalk alone,1
"Oh no, oh no, you're not there",1
I miss the old ways,1
But I guess I don't have a say,1
I was always turnin' out my empty pockets,1
"I call my mom, she said that it was for the best",1
Flush with the currency of cool,1
"You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious",1
All was quickly forgiven,1
I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer,1
In my peripheral vision,1
You had people who called you on unmarked numbers,1
Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk,1
Just like I had been when you were chasing me,1
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery,1
And the only way back to my dignity,1
Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk,1
With important men who think important thoughts,1
Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht,1
I don't have to pretend I like acid rock,1
"I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost)",1
Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left (Until I left),1
"I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)",1
"Platonic, it's just ended, so",1
"Truth is, I can't pretend it's",1
"Shared dinners, long weekends with?",1
What do you tell your friends we,1
"I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost",1
"Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less",1
"Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so",1
Like a vendetta-ta,1
'Cause you kiss me and it stops time,1
"I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming",1
"So light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)",1
"They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons",1
(It just felt so good),1
"And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'",1
"But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'",1
"He says, ""Don't throw away a good thing""",1
You gotta leave before you get left,1
"They never see it comin', what I do next",1
And I let them think they saved me,1
So I fly 'em all around the world,1
"I never trust a playboy, but they love me",1
"If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing",1
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me,1
Crimson red paint on my lips,1
Now all he thinks about is me,1
"'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three",1
And I make it look oh-so-easy,1
So I play 'em like a violin,1
"I never trust a narcissist, but they love me",1
"I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)",1
"I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)",1
"I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)",1
So here's the truth from my red lips,1
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks,1
"Light me up, go ahead and light me up (Light me up)",1
"Light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)",1
"Light me up (Light me up), light me up",1
Then why's it feel so good? (So good),1
Halo hiding my obsession,1
Echoes of your name inside my mind,1
"I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)",1
And I'm just gonna call you mine,1
My name is whatever you decide,1
"They say, ""She's gone too far this time""",1
I would lose my mind,1
I would waste my time,1
"For you, I would cross the line",1
"Shakin', pacin', I just need you",1
In the darkest little paradise,1
Something happened for the first time,1
Just playthings for me to use,1
And toyin' with them older guys,1
I've been breakin' hearts a long time,1
"Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)",1
"So bad, why's it feel so good?",1
"Why's it feel so good, good?",1
(You say I did something bad?),1
"Oh, you say I did something bad",1
"It just felt so good (Good), good",1
Most fun I ever had (Most fun I ever had),1
But why's it feel so (Good) good?,1
"It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold",1
"And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul",1
"I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me",1
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah),1
"We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat",1
"You so dope, don't overdose, I'm so stoked, I need a toast",1
"And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)",1
"Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)",1
I got some big enemies (Yeah),1
"I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)",1
I wanna be your first string,1
I wanna be your end game,1
So I take my time,1
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you),1
"In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)",1
"You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)",1
"In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)",1
"Oh, are you ready for it?",1
In the middle of the night in my dreams,1
No one has to know (No one has to know),1
"Never be the same now, now",1
"I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now",1
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure,1
"And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor",1
"We'll move to an island, and",1
"But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and",1
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry,1
"I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)",1
"I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)",1
"Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy",1
"I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)",1
"And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em",1
"I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't",1
"And I heard about you, ooh",1
"Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah",1
"Hey, big reputation, big reputation",1
I got some big enemies,1
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string),1
"I know what they all say, yeah",1
"With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it",1
"I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one",1
"After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July",1
"I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny",1
"For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities",1
"For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease",1
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song,1
"Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long",1
"The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me",1
"Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep",1
"Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders",1
"Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older",1
I know what they all say (I know what they all say),1
You hold me down and I protect you with my life,1
"You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)",1
"And I'm yours, but you're not mine",1
"Oh no, oh no, it's not fair",1
"And baby, for you, I would fall from grace",1
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you,1
Flashin' lights,1
Finally clean,1
"Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it",1
"Ten months older, I won't give in",1
"Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it",1
"Ten months sober, I must admit",1
Ah-ah-ah,1
Said I think I am finally clean,1
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,1
"I screamed so loud, but no one heard a thing",1
The water filled my lungs,1
"So I punched a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah",1
"One look, dark room, meant just for you",1
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room,1
"There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah",1
The rain came pouring down,1
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm,1
Hung my head as I lost the war,1
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore,1
"It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah",1
"I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I (I, I)",1
"(Hide) And I know, for you, it's always me (I know places)",1
"(I) In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)",1
"(Hide) And you know, for me, it's always you (I know places)",1
And we took a wrong turn,1
And we fell down a rabbit hole,1
You held on tight to me,1
'Cause nothing's as it seems,1
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland),1
"And life was never worse, but never better (Never better)",1
"We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)",1
And we pretended it could last forever (Could last forever),1
"And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad",1
To make you feel like what we had,1
You searched the world for somethin' else,1
I knew I had to go back home,1
"I reached for you, but you were gone",1
"In Wonderland, woah",1
"In Wonderland, eh, eh",1
But darlin',1
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind,1
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?,1
"And talking turned to screams, oh",1
And whispers turned to talkin',1
But there were strangers watchin',1
"All alone, or so it seemed",1
Too in love to think straight,1
"So, we went on our way",1
I should have slept with one eye open at night,1
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?,1
And spinning out of control,1
"(I) They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I know places)",1
Not this time,1
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time,1
"But you were still gone, gone, gone",1
"Lantern, burning",1
"Baby, I could go on and on, on and on",1
Struggled through the night with someone new,1
"Tossing, turning",1
I never dreamed of this,1
"In silent screams, in wildest dreams",1
"And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone",1
Currents swept you out again,1
Skies grew darker,1
"And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will",1
High tide came and brought you in,1
Clear blue water,1
That's how you got the girl,1
"That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh)",1
And that's how it works (Oh),1
"That's how you get the girl, girl (Get the girl, that's how it works)",1
"That's how you get the girl, girl ('Cause it's how it works)",1
I want you forever and ever (I want you forever and ever),1
I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better),1
And then you say,1
"And say you want me, yeah, yeah, 'cause",1
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks,1
Remind me how it used to be,1
Flickered in my mind for only you,1
"In losin' grip, on sinking ships",1
"Let them say what they want, we won't hear it",1
You showed up just in time,1
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences,1
"I know places, I know places",1
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down,1
"Baby, I know places we won't be found",1
"'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns",1
It could burn out,1
"Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out",1
"See the vultures circlin', dark clouds",1
Somethin' happens when everybody finds out,1
"It's a bad sign, bad sign",1
I can hear them whisper as we pass by,1
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight,1
You stand with your hand on my waistline,1
"I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I, I-I (I, I)",1
(This love) These hands had to let it go free and,1
"(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh",1
(This love) This love left a permanent mark,1
But you come back to what you need,1
"When you're young, you just run",1
"Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees",1
"Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave",1
"This love is glowing in the dark, oh",1
This love left a permanent mark,1
"And life was never worse, but never better",1
"Time moved too fast, you play it back",1
"Strike a match, then you blow it out",1
Love thorns all over this rose,1
"Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)",1
"In a world of boys, he's a gentleman",1
"And I break down, then he's pullin' me in",1
The wrong place at the right time,1
"Everyone wants him, that was my crime",1
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air,1
"Send the code, he's waitin' there",1
And if they call me a slut,1
They might as well be lookin' at us,1
But if I'm all dressed up,1
"I'll pay the price, you won't",1
Lovelorn and nobody knows,1
"Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke",1
Adorned with smoke on my clothes,1
Handprints in wet cement,1
Got lovesick all over my bed,1
"Got love-struck, went straight to my head",1
What if all I need is you?,1
"Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool",1
"Clink, clink, being this young is art",1
"Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard",1
We are too busy dancin' (Hey) to get knocked off our feet,1
"And every day is like a battle (And every day is like a battle, oh)",1
"'Cause baby, I could build a castle (Castle)",1
Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed),1
"We'll pay the price, I guess",1
But if I'm all dressed up (If I'm all dressed up),1
They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us),1
Now I'm pacin' on shaky ground,1
"Say, ""Don't go""",1
I'm holdin' out hope for you to,1
"Halfway out the door, but it won't close",1
I hold my breath a little bit longer,1
I'm standin' on a tightrope alone,1
"Oh no, oh no, it won't stop",1
Fading into madness,1
The waiting is a sadness,1
"Oh no, oh no, I'm unarmed",1
We're a shot in the darkest dark,1
I've known it from the very start,1
And if I'm gonna be (Drunk),1
And if they call me a (Slut),1
(Up),1
"I'm not saying, ""Do it anyway"" (Do it anyway)",1
"It's a big mistake, I said, ""It might blow up in your pretty face""",1
"Half awake, takin' your chances",1
You're not sayin' you're in love with me,1
"In the tangerine, neon light, this is luxury",1
"Half asleep, takin' your time",1
You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once),1
And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut),1
But every night with us is like a dream (Is like a dream),1
And every day is like a battle (Oh),1
Out of all the bricks they threw at me (At me),1
"We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything",1
"You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you (Ah)",1
"You are in love, true love, you are in love (Ah)",1
You can see it with the lights out,1
You can feel it on the way home,1
'Cause you can hear it in the silence,1
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words,1
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars,1
And you understand now,1
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown,1
You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round,1
"And you knew what it was, he is in love",1
"Pauses, then says, ""You're my best friend""",1
"One night, he wakes, strange look on his face",1
"You kiss on sidewalks, you fight and you talk",1
"One step, not much, but it said enough",1
"And for once, you let go of your fears and your ghosts",1
"You keep his shirt, he keeps his word",1
"Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday",1
"No proof, one touch, but you felt enough",1
"He says, ""Look up"" and your shoulders brush",1
The light reflects the chain on your neck,1
"Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight",1
"No proof, not much, but you saw enough",1
"You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you (Ah)",1
We wait for trains that just aren't comin',1
"'Cause baby, I could build a castle (Oh, baby, I could build a castle)",1
We show off our different scarlet letters,1
It's so romantic (It's so romantic),1
"Please, leave me stranded",1
"Please, take me dancin' and",1
"Please, take my hand and",1
"(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)",1
"(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) The best people in life are free",1
"(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) So, come on, come along with me",1
"(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) Oh",1
We are too busy dancin' (Yeah) to get knocked off our feet (Hey),1
"But, honey, most of them are true",1
The rumors are terrible and cruel,1
"We team up, then switch sides like a record changer",1
"We need love, but all we want is danger",1
"But I'm about to play my Ace, ah",1
"It's poker, he can't see it in my face",1
"We hang back, it's all in the timing",1
"We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding",1
We are too busy dancin' to get knocked off our feet,1
"Honey, life is just a classroom",1
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom,1
"We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doin'",1
"We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin",1
"Trust me, mine is better",1
"I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy",1
Just to touch your face,1
"Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah, yeah)",1
"You and me from the night before, but",1
Lived in the shade you were throwing,1
"'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?",1
How many days did I spend thinking,1
(I will hold on to you),1
"(To the memories, they will hold on to you)",1
You and me forevermore,1
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home,1
"I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe",1
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road,1
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi,1
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you're turning away,1
Call it what you want... to,1
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more,1
"Call it what you want, yeah",1
"(Call it what you want, call it)",1
Yes (Would you run away?),1
"But would you run away with me?""",1
"""You don't need to save me",1
"Holding my breath, slowly, I said",1
I recall late November,1
"Which is more than they can say, I",1
But 'cause he really knows me,1
Not because he owns me,1
Chain 'round my neck,1
"'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone",1
And I couldn't get away from ya,1
"In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah",1
"Your name on my lips, tongue-tied",1
"Killing me slow, out the window",1
"You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)",1
"Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price",1
"You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)",1
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night,1
"So, yeah",1
"It isn't hate, it's just indifference",1
"I did, I did, I did",1
It's all just a blur,1
I just forget what they were,1
Taught me some hard lessons,1
Sent me a clear message,1
"But you showed who you are, then one magical night",1
Even if nobody came to your show,1
"Would've been right there, front row",1
"Would've fought the whole town, so yeah",1
And I would've stuck around for ya,1
"As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground",1
Laughed on the school yard,1
"As soon as my rep started going down, down, down",1
Got out some popcorn,1
But then something happened one magical night,1
"Free rent, living in my mind",1
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck,1
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night,1
"Yeah, you know I did one thing right",1
"Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face",1
And here's to you,1
Had to listen to all this drama,1
And here's to my mama,1
He ain't reading what they call me lately,1
And here's to my baby,1
"They don't care about the he-said, she-said",1
Here's a toast to my real friends,1
This is why we can't have,1
"This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey",1
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)",1
If only you weren't so shady,1
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm),1
And so I took an axe to a mended fence,1
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you,1
Friends don't try to trick you,1
And therein lies the issue,1
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand,1
"There I was, giving you a second chance",1
It was so nice being friends again,1
"This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)",1
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates,1
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?,1
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year,1
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do,1
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)",1
Trust him like a brother,1
"This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)",1
"I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers",1
I did one thing right,1
At least I did one thing right,1
"Bridges burn, I never learn",1
And I know I make the same mistakes every time,1
They fade to nothing when I look at him,1
All the jokers dressing up as kings,1
All the drama queens taking swings,1
He built a fire just to keep me warm,1
Windows boarded up after the storm,1
All my flowers grew back as thorns,1
'Cause,1
I'm doin' better than I ever was,1
Nobody's heard from me for months,1
All the liars are calling me one,1
"They took the crown, but it's alright",1
I brought a knife to a gunfight,1
My castle crumbled overnight,1
"(He didn't care about that he-said, she-said)",1
"Nice things, honey",1
(And here's to my baby),1
I had to take them,1
(And here's to my real friends),1
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below,1
"And it's new, the shape of your body",1
And there are no rules when you show up here,1
"I never grew up, it's getting so old",1
"All the king's horses, all the king's men",1
Can you see right through me?,1
'Cause they see right through me,1
"Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling",1
And all of my heroes die all alone,1
"The room is on fire, invisible smoke",1
"I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost",1
Then I hate my reflection for years and years,1
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face,1
"But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?",1
"Dark side, I search for your dark side",1
"I jump from the train, I ride off alone",1
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine,1
"Easy they come, easy they go",1
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you,1
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies,1
"I say I don't want that, but what if I do?",1
"If I was a man, then I'd be the man",1
I'd be the man (I'd be the man),1
I'd be the man (Yeah),1
I'd be the man (Oh),1
"'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man",1
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey),1
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can),1
Couldn't put me together again,1
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends,1
His footprints on the sidewalk,1
Lead to where I can't stop,1
"I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)",1
"I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)",1
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah),1
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby),1
"""Where we gonna go?""",1
I whisper in the dark,1
"""So where we gonna go?""",1
"Boy, I understand",1
"He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand",1
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha),1
Or I won't stick around,1
He'd better lock it down,1
And he'll want me to stay,1
I'll make myself at home,1
When we get all alone,1
"Got that, ah, I mean",1
He got my heartbeat,1
No one understands,1
"It's like I'm 17, nobody understands",1
Body like it's mine,1
Make me wanna know that,1
His hands around a cold glass,1
Go there every night,1
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man),1
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man),1
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that),1
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me,1
All's well that ends well to end up with you,1
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue,1
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover,1
With every guitar string scar on my hand,1
"Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?",1
"I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all",1
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you,1
"This is our place, we make the call",1
We could let our friends crash in the living room,1
"Take me out, and take me home",1
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?,1
"And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear",1
"And this is our place, we make the rules",1
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January,1
"It's new, the shape of your body",1
"He looks up, grinning like a devil",1
"Oh, it's new, the shape of your body",1
"And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know",1
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone,1
"So cut the headlights, summer's a knife",1
"We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)",1
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times,1
"I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)",1
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover,1
"And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover",1
"So, it's okay that I'm mad",1
"You're my, my, my, my",1
They'd paint me out to be bad,1
"I'd be a bitch, not a baller",1
If I was out flashing my dollars,1
And it's okay if you're mad,1
And it's all good if you're bad,1
And getting bitches and models?,1
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars,1
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez,1
"And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play",1
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves,1
"What I was wearing, if I was rude",1
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve,1
"They'd say I hustled, put in the work",1
What's that like?,1
When everyone believes ya,1
I'd be an alpha type,1
I'd be a fearless leader,1
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you,1
And that would be okay for me to do,1
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to,1
"I would be complex, I would be cool",1
"Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover",1
"Oh, you're my, my, my, my",1
Bass beat rattling the chandelier,1
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea,1
"If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay",1
"Who's counting? (One, two, three)",1
He's in the club doin' I don't know what,1
"And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us",1
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong,1
You should think about the consequence,1
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk,1
Gorgeous,1
I do bad things with you,1
And I'm yours to lose (Baby),1
I'm yours to keep (Oh),1
"Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)",1
And all the pieces fall right into place (Pieces fall),1
I did a number on you,1
"The ties were black, the lies were white",1
"But when I get you alone, it's so simple",1
"Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone",1
But I got your heart,1
"I'm so chill, but you make me jealous",1
And wear you like a necklace,1
I make all your gray days clear,1
"All eyes on me, your illusionist",1
Met you in a bar,1
"But when you get me alone, it's so simple",1
"Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone",1
Back against the wall,1
"You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much",1
(I hate you so much),1
"Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine",1
You've ruined my life by not being mine,1
But I didn't mean it,1
I struck a match and blew your mind,1
"It was the best of times, the worst of crimes",1
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh),1
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have),1
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad),1
But what can I say? (I say),1
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious),1
"Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)",1
"Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone",1
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and,1
You make me so happy it turns back to sad,1
I feel like I might sink and drown and die,1
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine,1
"'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)",1
But if you're single that's honestly worse,1
"If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her",1
"Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)",1
And you should think about the consequence,1
"That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)",1
At you for making me feel this way,1
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous),1
I can't say anything to your face,1
"Gold cage, hostage to my feelings",1
Cut me into pieces,1
"You make everyone disappear, and",1
"Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share",1
"Long night, with your hands up in my hair",1
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?,1
"Handsome, you're a mansion with a view",1
"Third floor on the West Side, me and you",1
Isn't it... delicate?,1
"Yeah, I want you",1
Just think of the fun things we could do,1
"Oh damn, never seen that color blue",1
"Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you",1
"Come here, you can meet me in the back",1
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black,1
"Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?",1
"I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')",1
"If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)",1
"Don't blame me, love made me crazy (Oh-oh-oh)",1
"I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh-oh",1
"If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no)",1
"(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh-whoah-oh-oh)",1
My drug is my baby,1
"Oh, Lord, save me",1
You're touchin' me,1
"Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me",1
"Trip of my life, oh!",1
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs,1
"Yeah, I want you...",1
"All eyes on you, my magician",1
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep,1
See you in the dark,1
"""Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!"" (Oh)",1
"""I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now",1
Look what you just made me-),1
"(Ooh, look what you made me do",1
"Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours",1
"And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure",1
"The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama",1
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?),1
You asked me for a place to sleep,1
They once belonged to me,1
I don't like your kingdom keys,1
"Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)",1
You said the gun was mine,1
How you laugh when you lie,1
I don't like your perfect crime,1
"Of the fool, no, I don't like you",1
The role you made me play,1
Don't like your tilted stage,1
I don't like your little games,1
"I pretend you're mine, all the damn time",1
Sometimes when I look into your eyes,1
Are you ever dreaming of me?,1
And you didn't see it,1
In shades of gray in candlelight,1
Jump into the pool from the balcony,1
"Oh, through an avalanche? And",1
(Dancing with our hands tied),1
"Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)",1
"Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)",1
"Oh, yeah, we were dancing",1
If I could dance with you again (Again),1
If I could dance with you again,1
(Knew we had our hands tied),1
"Oh, keeping you with me, I-",1
"Oh, 'cause it's gravity",1
"I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted",1
"Say, say that we got it",1
"So, baby, can we dance?",1
I wanted to leave him,1
Deep fears that the world would divide us,1
"I, I loved you in spite of",1
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it,1
"People started talking, putting us through our paces",1
"And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis",1
"Oh, how was I to know? I-",1
"Oh, and you held me close",1
"Deep blue, but you painted me golden",1
"My, my love had been frozen",1
"Oh, how were you to know? And",1
"Oh, twenty-five years old",1
"Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)",1
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling),1
"(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)",1
"Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)",1
It was so nice throwing big parties,1
"You made your mark on me, golden tattoo",1
Say my name and everything just stops...,1
"My hands shake, I can't explain this",1
I woke up just in time,1
"My one and only, my lifeline",1
And I woke up just in time,1
"Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me",1
"My rebounds, my earthquakes",1
Flashback to my mistakes,1
"Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me",1
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached,1
Flashback when you met me,1
"Take it oh, ha, ha...",1
But they know nothing about-,1
Everyone thinks that they know us,1
You kiss my face and we're both drunk,1
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub,1
"And if I get burned, at least we were electrified",1
"Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try",1
"Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo",1
They got no idea about me and you,1
Our secret moments in a crowded room,1
"First sight, yeah, we love without reason",1
"I, I loved you in secret",1
"'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting",1
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known),1
Drivin' the getaway car,1
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!),1
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys,1
I left you in a motel bar,1
I'm in a getaway car,1
'Cause us traitors never win,1
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh),1
To the other side,1
Until I switched to the other side,1
"We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)",1
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!),1
"He poisoned the well, every man for himself",1
And now we're both sorry (We're both sorry),1
And a circus ain't a love story,1
"But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow",1
"While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', ""Go, go, go!""",1
And I was just drinkin',1
But you weren't thinkin',1
The light of freedom on my face,1
"It was the great escape, the prison break",1
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!),1
"He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself",1
I needed a reason,1
"We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)",1
I was ridin' in a getaway car,1
"King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa",1
"I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own",1
"Baby, all at once, this is enough",1
"Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff",1
Drinking beer out of plastic cups,1
Up on the roof with a school girl crush,1
With all these nights we're spending,1
My broken bones are mending,1
Is this the end of all the endings?,1
"I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)",1
"And all at once, you are the one",1
"Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa",1
"And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)",1
"King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa",1
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do),1
"(Inside my room, oh)",1
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury,1
Change my priorities,1
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep",1
"Late in the night, the city's asleep",1
"And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting",1
Never took me quite where you do,1
"Now you try on callin' me ""Baby"" like tryin' on clothes",1
We met a few weeks ago,1
"I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone",1
That I don't want you to go,1
"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh",1
"And you, ooh, know, oh, oh",1
"In New York, be here",1
"But, honey, I am no one's exception",1
And crossing so many lines,1
And you've been getting closer and closer,1
"It's kinda like a code, yeah",1
To do what's upstanding and right,1
But I feel a responsibility,1
I don't even know her,1
And everybody knows that,1
This is when the feeling sinks in,1
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around,1
"But you're in London, and I break down",1
This is falling for you when you are worlds away,1
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here,1
This is falling in love in the cruelest way,1
I guess you're in London today,1
I can't help but wish you took me with you,1
That never bring you back to me,1
Taxi cabs and busy streets,1
I never would've played so nonchalant,1
If I had known what I know now,1
And now that I can put this down,1
Without knowing anything at all,1
The feeling you can know so much,1
The delicate beginning rush,1
"This, I have previously learned",1
I just wanna make sure,1
You understand perfectly,1
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,1
About a beautiful boy who died,1
"Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say",1
"When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""",1
I remember the drive home,1
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you,1
You fought it hard like an army guy,1
And even the moment I knew,1
"I can still feel you hold my hand, little man",1
"Then jumping on me, waking me up",1
I remember you dancing before bedtime,1
Like we had our own secret club,1
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine,1
"Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs",1
I remember your little laugh,1
It would be a fine proposition,1
And tell her you're coming home,1
Wanna see you pick up your phone,1
Let's consider this lesson learned,1
You're about to lose your girl,1
"And, yeah, I might go with it",1
And take for granted what you have,1
You chase down the newest thing,1
While she waits up,1
I don't wanna need you this way,1
Spinning faster than the plane that took you,1
"But in my mind, I play it back",1
I try not to fall apart,1
So they follow me down the hall,1
When there's something really wrong,1
But your close friends always seem to know,1
Now I just wanna be alone,1
And the hours pass by,1
As I'm looking around the room,1
You said you'd be here,1
How you said you'd be here,1
As I comb back through my memory,1
People ask me how I've been,1
But the time is ticking,1
Just waiting for you to walk in,1
I've got my eye on the door,1
Christmas lights glisten,1
A million little shining stars had just aligned,1
And it would've felt like,1
"With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile",1
Should've burst through the door,1
You should've been there,1
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid,1
"And for the first time, what's past is past",1
And I wanna talk about that,1
That your family watches every single Christmas,1
And there in the bathroom,1
And the sinking feeling starts,1
"I told myself, don't get attached",1
As I say hopelessly,1
Right when I was just about to fall,1
"One last kiss, then catch your flight",1
Stumbled through the long goodbye,1
How strange that I don't know you at all,1
"4 AM, the second day",1
You said it in a simple way,1
"And I said, ""I'm sorry, too""",1
"And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""",1
You called me later,1
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,1
"Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew",1
"""Happy birthday to you""",1
"And they're all standing around me, singing",1
You should've been here,1
Is the one who didn't show?,1
When the one who means the most to you,1
And what do you do,1
In front of everyone you know?,1
When tears are streaming down your face,1
What do you say,1
But there was one thing missing (Missing),1
And asking me about you,1
"""He said he'd be here""",1
And it's about to be Halloween,1
"I remember the last day, when I kissed your face",1
And I almost brought him up,1
"What about your promises, promises, promises? (No)",1
"Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe",1
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent,1
"Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah",1
What a waste,1
"(What about your promises, promises, promises?)",1
"You call, but I won't hear it",1
I'm here on the kitchen floor,1
That you never should have made,1
"Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise",1
"Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah",1
What a shame,1
"What about your promises, promises?",1
And whispered in your ear,1
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new?,1
"And will you still want me, will you still want me",1
And I can feel time moving,1
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night,1
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out,1
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight,1
"Oh woah, oh woah, oh, oh",1
I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep,1
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me,1
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen,1
It's a fever dream,1
"We said, ""No one else""",1
This is the last time I'll ever call you,1
"Since you admitted it, I keep picturing",1
"Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it",1
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine,1
"3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine",1
"And now I'm standin', here hopin' this gets to you",1
"You could be the one that I love, I love",1
You could be the one that I love,1
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (You can't sleep at night),1
"And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you",1
"You could be the one that I love, mmm",1
If I'll ever see you again?,1
Where were you while I'm wondering,1
How is it in London?,1
'Cause now you're so far away and I'm down,1
"But time moves faster, replaying your laughter, disaster",1
"Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me",1
These days I'm restless,1
But now you're so far away and I'm down,1
"And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied",1
"And it's kinda frightening standin' here waitin', waitin'",1
I know that you like me,1
"I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it",1
"How could you do this, babe?",1
"What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away",1
"I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe",1
I know someday I'm gonna meet her,1
How did I go from growing up to breaking down?,1
People love an ing√©nue,1
"Oh, you never thought I'd run",1
Talking down to me like I'd always be around,1
"But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now",1
Like it was in the beginning,1
Hoping they might turn sweet again,1
I waited on every careless word,1
And it was always on your terms,1
At any given minute,1
Than needing a man who could change his mind,1
I know I'm probably better off all alone,1
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand,1
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run,1
"Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it""",1
"I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror",1
"Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic",1
And I see the permanent damage you did to me,1
Than lovin' a man who didn't know what he had when he had it,1
I know I'm probably better off on my own,1
You were my best four years,1
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?,1
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?,1
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?,1
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?,1
"Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray, we'll just disappear",1
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun,1
I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have,1
And someone else lights up the room?,1
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that,1
Are we only buying time 'til I lose your attention,1
From turning red and faking smiles,1
And my cheeks are growing tired,1
And roll your eyes with affection,1
When you can't blame it on my youth,1
"How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room?",1
And I know it's sad but this is what I think about,1
Once I've lost my novelty?,1
"Lord, what will become of me",1
"And say, ""She looks like she's been through it""",1
Shoot you down and then they sigh,1
When you're soaring through the sky,1
Criticize the way you fly,1
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it,1
"""Girls, go out and have your fun""",1
They tell you while you're young,1
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man,1
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand,1
(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man),1
"We might still be in love, if you were a better man",1
"(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)",1
I wonder what we would've become,1
I wish you were a better man,1
But you start to talk about the movies,1
And we walked down the block to my car,1
"That's how you get the girl, girl, yeah, yeah",1
I imagine you are home,1
Disappear when you come back,1
Just for you to go again,1
And all the times I let you in,1
But I was there to watch you leave,1
You wear your best apology,1
You find yourself at my door,1
No reasons why,1
"I'm breaking, no past",1
And everything feels better,1
And you open your eyes into mine,1
"In your room, all alone",1
All roads they lead me here,1
And I see your face in every crowd,1
I'm not sure how I got there,1
Find myself at your door,1
"(Ha-ha-ha, that's so fun)",1
"But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay",1
"So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay",1
"No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad",1
"Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time",1
"I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life",1
"All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me",1
"I just like hanging out with you, all the time",1
"My fears, my hopes, and dreams",1
Everything is better,1
"I'm aching, run fast",1
Nowhere to hide,1
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,1
And the story's got dust on every page,1
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way,1
And for the first time I had something to lose,1
"We block the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""",1
We had this big wide city all to ourselves,1
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,1
And darling it was good,1
And that was the first day,1
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made,1
Yeah you skip the conversation when you already know,1
"Took off faster than a green light, go",1
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme,1
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time,1
And Lord it took me away,1
While having coffee all alone,1
I was reminiscing just the other day,1
(You break my heart),1
(This is the last time I'm asking you why),1
(Put my name at the top of your list),1
(This is the last time I'm asking you this),1
"This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore",1
This is the last time I let you in my door,1
This is the last time I say it's been you all along,1
You took the time to memorize me,1
"But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay",1
No choice but to,1
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind,1
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights,1
"Like, ever",1
"We called it off again last night, but",1
"I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, I love you",1
Remember how that lasted for a day?,1
"""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""",1
Then you come around again and say,1
When you said you needed space (What?),1
We hadn't seen each other in a month,1
"Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like",1
I remember when we broke up the first time,1
"Looking out at the city, and I hope",1
And I almost do,1
And asking me if I wanna try again with you,1
"In my dreams, you're touching my face",1
"And I confess, baby",1
It's probably better off this way,1
"Oh, we made quite a mess, babe",1
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye,1
"I bet it never, ever occurred to you",1
"'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply",1
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you,1
"Looking out at the city, and I bet",1
"And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right",1
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine,1
And I love you because you have given me,1
"You called me up again tonight, but",1
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing,1
Who took all of their problems out on me,1
"Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers",1
"And said, ""Okay, let's talk""",1
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet,1
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved,1
"This morning, I said we should talk about it",1
But you stayed,1
I was expecting some dramatic turn away,1
"I threw my phone across the room, at you",1
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night,1
Getting back together (Yeah),1
"We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh)",1
"We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)",1
"We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together",1
"(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together",1
"Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""",1
"And I'm like, ""I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?",1
"Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""",1
"And I used to say, ""Never say never""",1
"I used to think that we were forever, ever",1
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah),1
"We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together",1
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now,1
"'Cause darling, it was good",1
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid,1
It was the best night,1
"He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me",1
"You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""",1
"He said, ""Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change",1
"And I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""",1
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince,1
The night we snuck into a yacht club party,1
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in,1
"Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild",1
Picks me up late one night,1
"I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45",1
Never would forget how he moved,1
"I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""",1
It was good,1
"All my days, I'll know your face",1
All I know is a new found grace,1
And everything has changed,1
All I know is pouring rain,1
So dust off your highest hopes,1
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours,1
And let me know that it's not all in my mind,1
And meet me there tonight,1
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time,1
Come back and tell me why,1
"Taking flight, making me feel right",1
"""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?",1
"Don't you dream impossible things?""",1
"Like, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""",1
"Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy",1
"I'm coming off a little shy, but I do",1
We tell stories and you don't know why,1
"Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do",1
You said you never met one girl who,1
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid,1
"And you don't know how nice that is, but I do",1
You pull my chair out and help me in,1
I walk to you,1
But you got here early and you stand and wave,1
"Walked in, expecting you'd be late",1
"He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do",1
Turn the lock and put my headphones on,1
"He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do",1
Took a deep breath in the mirror,1
Don't you dream impossible things?,1
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight? (Ooh, hoo, hoo)",1
"Like we dream impossible dreams (Ooh, hoo, hoo)",1
"Like starlight, starlight (Ooh, hoo, hoo)",1
Like we dream impossible dreams,1
"Oh my, what a marvelous tune",1
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream,1
"Ooh-ooh, we could get married",1
"Ooh-ooh, dancing with me",1
"The beautiful kind, making up for lost time",1
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies,1
And open up the door for you,1
"So overnight, you look like a sixties queen",1
You had it figured out since you were in school,1
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream,1
"In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame",1
New to town with a made-up name,1
"What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair",1
"What we had, a beautiful magic love there",1
"What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful",1
A beautiful magic love there,1
"Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back",1
"Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?",1
"Silence, the train runs off its tracks",1
"Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting",1
"What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh)",1
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there,1
"And darling, they all look like me",1
And you've got your demons,1
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you,1
"And we both wake in lonely beds, different cities",1
"In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation",1
"Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait",1
"I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket",1
"Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late",1
"Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket",1
"Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool",1
Like diamonds in the sky,1
"And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down",1
"Now, it's big black cars and Riviera views",1
"And all my walls stood tall, painted blue",1
"In the back of my mind, making me feel like",1
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile,1
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago,1
Know something now I didn't before,1
Is I know something now,1
All I knew this morning when I woke,1
(You good to go?),1
"Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh",1
But I think you got it right,1
'Cause now my name is up in lights,1
"And it took some time, but I understand it now",1
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square,1
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,1
"How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out",1
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,1
"It was a few years later, I showed up here",1
You wonder if you'll make it out alive,1
And all the young things line up to take your place,1
"'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used",1
"And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused",1
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page,1
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you,1
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree,1
"And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh",1
"Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles",1
"Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)",1
But I don't know what to say,1
"Here you are now, callin' me up",1
All you had to do was stay,1
Off the road,1
All I know is that you drove us,1
The less I know,1
The more I think about it now,1
When you say you've changed,1
And people like me wanna believe you,1
The love they gave away,1
"Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)",1
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah),1
"That's what they don't see, mm-mm",1
"Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)",1
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah),1
"Oh, I remember",1
"(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)",1
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?),1
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?),1
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?),1
"You were lookin' at me, oh, you were looking at me",1
"When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me",1
But the monsters turned out to be just trees,1
"I walked out, I said, ""I'm settin' you free""",1
I've been pickin' up the pieces,1
Of the mess you made,1
The love they pushed aside,1
But people like me are gone forever,1
I'm lightnin' on my feet,1
I never miss a beat,1
"Can't stop, won't stop movin'",1
"At least, that's what people say, mm-mm",1
But I can't make them stay,1
I go on too many dates (Haha),1
Got nothin' in my brain,1
I stay out too late,1
All you had to do was (Stay; Ooh),1
(Ah) All you had to do was (Stay; Oh),1
"Now that it's just too late, well, it could've been easy (All you had to do was stay)",1
"(Stay; Ah) Hey, now you say you want it back",1
"(Stay; Ah) Hey, all you had to do was stay",1
All you had to do was,1
"Oh, all you had to do was",1
"Not like this, not like this",1
But not like this,1
"You were all I wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)",1
You ended it,1
"This was what you wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)",1
Let me remind you,1
"All you had to do was (Stay, stay, stay, stay)",1
When you say goodbye,1
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?,1
"But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you",1
"When you started crying, baby, I did too",1
"I said, ""I've been there too a few times""",1
"He says, ""What you heard is true, but I",1
Some other girl,1
"That you've been out and about with some other girl""",1
"I say, ""I heard, oh",1
"Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, oh, yeah",1
Takes me home,1
"He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mmm",1
So it goes,1
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt,1
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye,1
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time,1
"Know exactly where it leads, but I",1
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I,1
(Heard from you),1
It's been a while since I have even heard from you,1
"Fade into view, oh",1
Could end in burnin' flames or paradise,1
Long drive,1
"You come and pick me up, no headlights",1
Midnight,1
Or with a nasty scar (Or leave a nasty scar),1
We'll take this way too far (Ooh),1
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah),1
"Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you"" and I",1
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye,1
Twenty stitches in the hospital room,1
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt),1
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?,1
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh),1
"Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying",1
"Baby, like we stood a chance",1
To move the furniture so we could dance,1
"When we decided, we decided",1
The night we couldn't quite forget,1
"Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck",1
Then fall back together (Back together),1
Last December (Last December),1
But we were in screaming color,1
The rest of the world was black and white,1
Then discovered (Then discovered),1
You took a Polaroid of us,1
We were lying on your couch,1
It all seems so simple,1
"And when we go crashin' down (And when we go), we come back every time",1
"Oh, 'cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye",1
"Woah, woah, oh (Out of style)",1
"Yeah, just take me home (Ah)",1
Just take me home (Ah),1
Take me home (Ah),1
"'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go), we never go out of style",1
"And that's what they don't see, mm-mm",1
I'm dancin' on my own (Dancin' on my own),1
"Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love",1
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done),1
And his voice is a familiar sound,1
"His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room",1
"I said, ""No one has to know what we do""",1
My one condition is,1
I can see the end as it begins,1
But this is gonna take me down,1
Nothing lasts forever,1
"I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""",1
"Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""",1
"He said, ""Let's get out of this town",1
"'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey (Ooh, woah, no)",1
"And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey ('Cause now we got bad blood)",1
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go),1
And I don't think we can solve them (Think we can solve them),1
"'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey (Bad blood)",1
You know it used to be mad love (Mad love),1
"If you love like that, blood runs cold",1
"If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Hey), mmm",1
You say sorry just for show (Hey),1
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (Hey),1
"If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Ghosts)",1
You say sorry just for show,1
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes,1
"And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey",1
Nothin' lasts forever,1
But this is gettin' good now,1
And when we've had our very last kiss,1
My last request it is,1
"Broke your heart, I'll put it back together (Put it back together)",1
"And now, you say",1
That's how you lost the girl,1
"When you left her all alone and never told her why, why",1
"Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh",1
"Of pictures in frames, of kisses on cheeks, cheeks",1
"Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah, yeah",1
"And then, you say",1
That's how you get the girl,1
"And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want",1
"Say, ""It's been a long six months""",1
"She'll open up the door and say, ""Are you insane, -ane?""",1
"Stand there like a ghost, shakin' from the rain, rain",1
"Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah-ah)",1
"Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)",1
Even if it's just pretend,1
Standing in a nice dress,1
(Follow you around),1
Follow (Follow) you (You) around (Around),1
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down),1
Follow you around,1
Burnin' it down,1
"Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)",1
"'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey",1
"So if you're comin' my way, just don't",1
"And time can heal, but this won't",1
"You say, ""It's in the past,"" you drive straight ahead",1
It's 2 AM in your car,1
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (You got to)",1
"I, I, I shake it off (Yeah), I shake it off",1
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (Off)",1
"I shake it off, I shake it off (Off)",1
"And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (They fake and fake and fake)",1
"Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (Mmm)",1
"I shake it off, I shake it off (Hey)",1
"And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (Haters gonna hate)",1
"Yeah, oh, woah",1
"We could shake, shake, shake",1
"Won't you come on over, baby?",1
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair,1
"She's like, ""Oh my God"" (Haha), but I'm just gonna shake",1
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend,1
You could've been gettin' down to this sick beat,1
"And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world",1
"Just think, while you've been gettin' down and out about the liars",1
"Hey, hey, hey",1
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (Haha)",1
"Can't stop, won't stop groovin'",1
"That's what they don't know, mm-mm",1
"And that's what they don't know, mm-mm",1
"Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start",1
You're thinkin' that I hate you now,1
All these things will catch up to you,1
'Cause you still don't know what I never said,1
"Now, did you think it all through?",1
"These kinda wounds, they last and they last",1
So don't think it's in the past,1
Still got scars on my back from your knife,1
Did you think we'd be fine?,1
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me,1
And rub it in so deep,1
"Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe",1
Did you have to hit me,1
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted,1
Did you have to ruin,1
I was thinking that you could be trusted,1
Did you have to do this?,1
"(I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would)",1
But it made us turn right back around,1
Makes you wanna run and hide,1
"See your face, hear my voice in the dark",1
"2 AM, here we are",1
"I wish you would, I wish you would (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)",1
Then it makes you turn right back around,1
Makes you want to run and hide,1
"Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you",1
It's 2 AM in my room,1
And you love the game (Love the game),1
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane),1
"You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm",1
"There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame",1
I'll take it when I leave,1
There's a heart on your sleeve,1
Since I gave it to you,1
"And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket",1
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes,1
I could see this view a hundred times,1
"No one to be, no one to tell",1
And I'll sing like no one cares,1
So you laugh like a child,1
We can go where our eyes can take us,1
Take it with you,1
"""I'll wait for you""",1
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane),1
"There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote",1
I'd drive away before I let you go,1
"And my so-called friends, they don't know",1
We shouldn't be in this town,1
"Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around",1
"One, two, three, four",1
"I say, ""Believe in one thing, I won't go away""",1
I'd be in pieces on the floor,1
"At 5 AM, wasted",1
"At 3 AM, pacing",1
I'll be your summer sun forever,1
And hold it for you,1
We can go like they're trying to chase us,1
There's been this hole in my heart,1
This thing was a shot in the dark,1
Not trying to fall in love,1
We never saw it coming,1
And so it was,1
They don't know how much I miss you,1
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture,1
They weren't riding in the car when we both fell,1
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel,1
But they all lead back to you,1
I drive down different roads,1
Everything I'm going through,1
My friends all say they know,1
And I don't seem broken hearted,1
I never go alone,1
Every weekend the same party,1
I'd write this in the sky,1
"Ooh, and we'll run",1
"Go where no one else is, run (And we run, and we run, and we run)",1
"We can go where our eyes can take us (And we run, and we run, and we run)",1
"Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run)",1
"Darling, let's run (And we run, and we run, and we run)",1
"Like you'd run from the law (And we run, and we run, and we run)",1
"And I'll hold onto you while we run (And we run, and we run, and we run)",1
Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart,1
I didn't know,1
Please don't go,1
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and,1
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me,1
"Scared not to be hip, scared to get old",1
"Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul",1
Is the love that you had?,1
That the love that you're lookin' for,1
Does it make you feel sad,1
"""Why did you let her go?""",1
"The voices so loud, sayin'",1
"Oh, block it all out",1
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy,1
Do you have all the space that you need?,1
Mr. Superior Thinkin',1
"You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes",1
"But reality crept in, you said we're too different",1
And you and I fell like an early spring snow,1
"But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for",1
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills,1
"I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion",1
"Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills",1
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community,1
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave,1
I bet you couldn't believe,1
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of,1
"Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life",1
"Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free",1
I bet it's hard to believe,1
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it,1
That it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave,1
If I was standing there in your apartment,1
My voice comes out screaming,1
"Long gone, not even listening",1
"He's up, 5 AM, wasted",1
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead,1
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head,1
"When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe",1
His laugh is a symphony,1
Forcing smiles and never minds,1
He seems fine most of the time,1
My voice comes out begging,1
"He says, ""It's not just a phase I'm in""",1
"He's up, 3 AM, pacing",1
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity,1
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be,1
"He says, ""Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?""",1
"""Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me""",1
I bet you think about me when you say,1
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch,1
I bet you think about me in your house,1
At your cool indie music concerts every week,1
I bet you think about me when you're out,1
"And, yeah, I bet you think about me",1
But we did like children running,1
Back then we didn't know,1
We broke the status quo,1
"Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy",1
"""Oh, my God, look at that face",1
Saw you there and I thought,1
"Magic, madness, heaven, sin",1
"Nice to meet you, where you been?",1
"Welcome to New York, so bright, they never blind me",1
"Welcome to New York, the lights are so bright, but they never blind me",1
"Welcome to New York (New soundtrack), it's been waitin' for you",1
"The lights are so bright, but they never blind me",1
"It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat",1
"But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything",1
"Like any true love, it drives you crazy",1
"Like any real love, it's ever-changing",1
"Like any great love, it keeps you guessing",1
"Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you",1
Boys and boys and girls and girls,1
And you can want who you want,1
Everybody here was someone else before,1
"Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer",1
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors,1
And it said,1
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before,1
Everybody here wanted somethin' more,1
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats,1
You look like my next mistake,1
"New money, suit and tie",1
"It was rare, you remember it all too well",1
I can read you like a magazine,1
"It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm",1
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh),1
"'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream",1
But you'll come back each time you leave,1
I get drunk on jealousy,1
"""Oh, my God, who is she?""",1
"Keep you second guessin', like",1
Rose garden filled with thorns,1
I can make all the tables turn,1
"Screaming, crying, perfect storms",1
"Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no",1
Be that girl for a month,1
Find out what you want,1
"You're the king, baby, I'm your queen",1
"Stolen kisses, pretty lies",1
"Cherry lips, crystal skies",1
'Cause we're young and we're reckless,1
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend,1
Grab your passport and my hand,1
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends,1
"So, hey, let's be friends",1
And I know you heard about me,1
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly,1
"Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow",1
"Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well",1
Then we broke each other's hearts,1
"To remember it all too well, yeah",1
"You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath",1
And there we are again when nobody had to know,1
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame,1
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you,1
After three months in the grave,1
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same,1
'Til we were dead and gone and buried,1
"He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was",1
"And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now",1
"Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town",1
"And you were tossing me the car keys, ""fuck the patriarchy""",1
"You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me",1
"""I miss you like it was the very first night""",1
And I'd say to you,1
I wish that we could go back in time,1
"""Do you know how much I miss you?""",1
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper,1
I was riding in the car when we both fell,1
I remember the night at the hotel,1
No one knows how much I miss you,1
No one knows about the words that we whisper,1
"Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway",1
But don't forget about the night out in L.A,1
Sacred prayer and we'd swear,1
"Well, maybe we got lost in translation",1
"Just between us, do you remember it all too well?",1
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise,1
"Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?",1
And how it glistened as it fell,1
I still remember the first fall of snow,1
'Cause in this city's barren cold,1
"Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?",1
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?,1
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight,1
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones,1
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age",1
"And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes",1
"And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""",1
"But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come",1
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show,1
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes,1
"That's what happened, you",1
"Some actress asking me what happened, you",1
Not weeping in a party bathroom,1
"A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you",1
"The idea you had of me, who was she?",1
And that made me want to die,1
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine,1
Every time you double-cross my mind,1
"They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell",1
My heart won't start anymore',1
