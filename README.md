#### How well do you know Taylor Swift's lyrics? :D

This is still a work in progress, but for entertainment purposes, [here](https://jasminex21.shinyapps.io/tayLyrics/) is the link to the game.

#### Here is the general layout of the app:

Instructions are provided on the left sidebar, as needed.

#### Some things I would like to add/update: 
- Possibly filter out lyrics that are < 5 words in length for medium and hard mode, and also the lyrics that are simply the same word repeated over and over
- Add more detailed statistics:
  - Pie charts showing album distribution of correct and incorrect (gave up) responses
- Streaks
- Saving user data (your highest %, longest streak, etc.)
- Update the lyrics dataset - remove non-Taylor's Versions who already have Taylor's Versions, and possibly add non-album singles e.g. Only the Young, Christmas Tree Farm (but potentially provide users with the option of removing them)
