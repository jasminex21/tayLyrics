#### How well do you know Taylor Swift's lyrics? :D

This is still a work in progress, but for entertainment purposes, [here](https://jasminex21.shinyapps.io/tayLyrics/) is the link to the game.

#### Here is the general layout of the app:

#### TODO: 
- Address first: get the hints to show up on top of each other instead of Hint 2 obscuring Hint 1
- Make the 2nd hint the line after instead of line before
- Possibly filter out lyrics that are < 5 words in length for medium and hard mode, and also the lyrics that are simply the same word repeated over and over
- Add more detailed statistics:
  - Pie charts showing album distribution of correct and incorrect (gave up) responses
- Saving user data (your highest %, longest streak, etc.)
  - Streaks in general would be cool
- Possibly add non-album singles e.g. Only the Young, Christmas Tree Farm (but provide users with the option of removing them)
- (SHOULD NOW BE FIXED) I could have seen wrong but there might be an issue with the previous/next lyric hint where the lyric came from an entirely different song? Maybe I imagined this.
- Add option to set seed for the randomizer - but might need to have an info button for it for an explanation of what it does
