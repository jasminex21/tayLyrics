#### Some things I would like to add/update: 
- Make user interface more aesthetically pleasing and colorful
- Possibly filter out lyrics that are < 5 words in length for medium and hard mode, and also the lyrics that are simply the same word repeated over and over
- Add more hints; maybe something like, "The song title starts with..."
- Add more detailed statistics; "Your best album is... and your worst album is..."
- Streaks
- Saving user data (your highest %, longest streak, etc.)
