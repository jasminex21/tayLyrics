**THIS README IS OUT-OF-DATE**

I am currently working on a new version of the app. The link still functions fine; however, the info contained in the readme has not been updated yet.

#### How well do you know Taylor Swift's lyrics? :D

Lyrics from debut up to 1989 (Taylor's Version) are included. I will update this to include The Tortured Poet's Department as soon as I can!

This is still a work in progress, but for entertainment purposes, [here](https://jasminex21.shinyapps.io/tayLyrics/) is the link to the game.
